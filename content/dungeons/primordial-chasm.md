Shiren 5's version of the series favorite unidentified items post-game dungeon.<br/>
It's always daytime, the item table features a wide variety of items, and NPCs don't appear.<br/>
The first clear only requires you to reach 50F, and then the full 99F version is unlocked.

It's a standard dungeon, but the variety of strategies that can be used to clear it makes it extremely popular.<br/>
There are many weapon and shield options, and lots of ways to tailor the experience to your playstyle.<br/>
It tests identification, synthesis, Nigiri Morph Factory, collecting arrows, rushing stairs, and other techniques.<br/>
Grinding can be effective, but Wind of Kron and Ominous Auras both occur earlier than in other dungeons.

- A shop is guaranteed to be generated on 10F, 25F, 50F, and 75F.
- Imitation / odd effect items (Dracon Grass, Bankruptcy Scroll, etc.) can appear starting on 18F.

# Strategy

The basic strategy is to make your preparations between 1\~33F, and then dive through most floors.

</ul>

### Identifying Items

See [Identifying Items](/guides/identifying-items) for the basics.

The "YOLO" method where you just use the item is going to be the most used method in this dungeon.<br/>However, shops appear quite often, so being able to identify by price is also important.

Imitation items like Dracon Grass can appear starting on 18F,<br/>
so some players ignore unidentified items after 17F if they managed to identify the essentials.

#### YOLO Method

Identify Scroll or Identify Pot can identify items, and possibilities can be narrowed by checking prices.<br/>However, both of the above are unidentified at first, and if you have an inventory full of unidentified items,<br/>your run is likely to end if you encounter a tough situation where you need to use an item.<br/>Grasses and scrolls are consumed, but staves and talismans remain on hand.

When using unidentified items, there's no way to avoid using a negative effect item.<br/>The key is to put yourself in a position that limits how much a negative effect affects you beforehand.<br/>※ Items like Imabikiso and Amnesia Grass can only be found in shops (and Snacky, Maneater) here.

It's not realistic to account for every possible case, but the following are standard precautions:

<table class="dungeonTable">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Category</th>
      <th>Precaution</th>

    <tr>
      <td>Use after wiping out nearby enemies.</td>
      <td>Items that hinder combat like<br/>Sleepy Grass and Swift Foe Scroll.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Pot, Scroll (Select-type)</td>
      <td>Choose an unneeded item</td>
      <td>There's a chance you'll lose the item.<br/>Pot: 4-2-8, Black Hole, fragrance, etc.<br/>Scroll: Sale, Onigiri, Curse, etc.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="2">Staff, Talisman</td>
      <td>Use it on an enemy you can defeat if<br/>it happens to level up.</td>
      <td>Glorious Staff, Glorious Talisman</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Use it on a distant and weak enemy.</td>
      <td>Items that put you in a disadvantage<br/>like Pinning Staff and Swift Talisman.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Grass

Grass items are important synthesis ingredients, so avoid using them until Mixer (8-10F) floors.<br/>But if you find multiple copies of the same grass, it's fine to think about using one of them.<br/>Once you're past Mixer floors, it's generally fine to use grass after exploring the floor.<br/>The price range for synthesis ingredients are 100, 300, and 500.

Unidentified items are auto-identified if synthesis is successful, and Revival Grass is more common,<br/>so you tend to miss out and make the adventure harder for yourself if you use grasses early on.<br/>It's fine to eat grass that couldn't be synthesized, but don't use 500G grasses on floors<br/>where a shop is present, since Rage Grass could easily end your run.

Prices to remember:

- 50 --- Herb or Fine Grass (18F+)
- 100 --- Antidote Grass (<span class="greenText">Anti-Drain</span>), Warp Grass (<span class="greenText">Anti-Floating</span>), Otogiriso (<span class="greenText">Uplifting</span>), 1 other.
- 200 --- Heal Grass
- 300 --- Confusion Grass (<span class="greenText">Confusing</span>), Blinding Grass (<span class="greenText">Blinding</span>), Perception Grass (<span class="greenText">Anti-Cyclops</span>), 6 others.
- 500 --- Sleepy Grass (<span class="greenText">Sedating</span>), Dragon Grass (<span class="greenText">Anti-Dragon</span>), Life Grass (<span class="greenText">Energizing</span>), 3 others.
- 1000 --- Revival Grass or Gut Grass (18F+)
- 1500 --- Undo Grass or Repeat Grass (18F+)

Amnesia Grass and Imabikiso can appear in shops from 12F, and SuperUnlucky Seed from 30F.<br/>Snacky, Munchy, and Maneaters drop shop table items, so don't let your guard down.

#### Scrolls

There are few scrolls that can be identified via synthesis, so you tend to use scrolls to identify them.<br/>Read unidentified scrolls while standing on the stairs in case it's Muzzled or Grounded,<br/>or at the entrance of a room if you want to see if it's a Mnster House Scrl.

Save 800G scrolls you find before Mixer floors in case one of them is a Desert Scroll.<br/>
Use 500G (select-type scrolls) on an unneeded weapon or shield in case it's Fate, Earth, or Plating.

Prices to remember:

- 100 --- Navigation Scroll or Oil Scroll
- 200 --- Identify Scroll
- 300 --- Collection Scroll
- 500 --- (Select-type scrolls)
- 800 --- Desert Scroll (<span class="greenText">Anti-Aquatic</span>), 6 others.
- 1000 --- Confusion Scroll, Fixer Scroll, Immunity Scroll, Mnster House Scrl, 6 others.
- 3000 --- Lost Scroll (<span class="greenText">Bored</span>), 2 others.

#### Bracelets

It's fine to equip unidentified bracelets up until 8F since Karakuroids (6-8F) can create Strip Traps,<br/>but it's best to wait until you encounter a shop to identify by price from 9F onward.<br/>※ Never equip unidentified bracelets starting on 18F - it could be Itemphobic, Dozer Bracelet, etc.

The essential price point to remember for bracelets is 5000G.<br/>
The only 5000G bracelets on the ground before 18F are Alleyway, Blink, Explosion, and Nonary.<br/>Nonary is always cursed, and the other 3 are never sold in shops in Primordial Chasm,<br/>so bracelets being sold for 5000G in shops can only be Monster Detector, Item Detector, Heal, or Waterwalk.<br/>Monsterphobic and Itemphobic can appear in shops starting from 18F, but Itemphobic is always cursed.<br/>Wall Clip Bracelet can only be found in elite shops.

The 3000G bracelets are harder to identify, so they're a good candidate for Identify Pots.<br/>Alert and Mojo are the ones to watch for in particular.

#### Pots

Modder's Pot and Fever Pot can't be found on the ground.<br/>It's best to insert items other than arrows and talismans to identify pots.

### Equipment

See [Rune Details](/system/synthesis-runes#rune-details) to get an idea of synthesis priority.

Monster Detector, Wall Clip Bracelet, and Heal Bracelet are the 3 "sacred treasures" of the dungeon,<br/>but Wall Clip Bracelet is exclusively found in elite shops, so you're unlikely to obtain it.<br/>Therefore, equipment sets that activate 2 bracelet resonance aren't a high priority.<br/>Instead, the ideal pairing is any weapon that gains ∞ rune slots at Lv8 + Day Shield.

#### Weapon

##### Basic

- Dontakui, Bladite
    - Dotanuki and Bladite have 6 rune slots at Lv2, making early game synthesis easier.
    - Both are simple weapons with fast growth rates, making them great options.
- Red Blade
    - High base attack, but struggles with rune slots and growth rate.
    - Gains <span class="greenText">Uplifting</span> at Lv3, further making it lag behind the above two options.
    - Gains <span class="greenText">Flame Shot</span> at Lv8, which slows down the pace of the game.
- Kabura Katana
    - High base attack, but starts with only 2 rune slots, and incredibly slow growth rate.<br/>You can nearly level 2 Red Blades to Lv8 in the same amount of time it takes to level this to Lv8.
    - If you stick with it and hunt Maneaters, it gains at least 1 slot per level up and ends up powerful.
- Beast Fang
    - Faster growth rate than Dotanuki, and has enough base attack to at least be viable.

##### Status - Chance to inflict status increases based on level

- Baffle Axe
    - Fast growth rate, very high rune count.<br/>Great for those who like to overwhelm monsters with the power of runes.
- Blurry Stick
    - Slower growth rate than Baffle Axe, but not bad.
- Nap Rattle, Shockuto
    - Powerful ability, but neither one gains ∞ slots at Lv8.

##### Type Effective - Damage multiplier increases based on level

- Water Cutter, Scythe
    - Fast growth rate, and effective against a wide variety of monsters.
- Drain Dagger
    - Ensures you one-shot Absorbiphants, along with annoying Scorpions and Polygon Spinnas.
- Lizard Lasher
    - Hopodiles, Shaggas, and Dragons have high stats, so this is a great help against them.<br/>Slower growth rate than the others.
- Myopic Masher
    - Narrow range of effectiveness, but fast growth rate and high rune count.
- Sky Splitter
    - Low base attack and slow growth rate, but can be viable if you level it by hunting Maneaters.

##### Dirk of Debts

- Dirk of Debts
    - Fast growth rate, gains 2 slots per level, and your direct attacks deal x2.0 damage at Lv8.
    - It varies a bit based on strength and buffs, but it's possible to one-shot even end game monsters.
    - Tricky to wield early\~mid game, but once you reach the 75F shop, you can main it without worry.<br/>Gitan Mamels and Kleptoads (80-82F), Ultra Gazers (88-93F) also help with cost.
    - Only recommended if you're confident in your ability to steal from shops.

#### Shield

##### Damage Reduction

- Day Shield
    - Since this is a day-only dungeon, it's an unconditional 60% damage reduction at Lv8.<br/>Nothing rivals it, so just use it as a main shield if you find it.
- Binary Shield
    - 85% damage reduction if last digit of current HP is 1 or 0 at Lv8.<br/>It gets tiresome to keep track of HP, but it's extremely effective if you're diligent.
- Pauper's Plank
    - Damage reduction increases to 50% at Lv8, but with a pretty heavy drawback of 250G per hit.

##### Basic

- Red Shield, Targite
    - Far less effective than % damage reduction.
    - Solid early on, but not much help against end game monsters.

##### Leveling for Runes

Some shields are nice to level as synthesis ingredients thanks to their added runes.

- Plain Targe
    - Gains <span class="greenText">CR Diet</span> at Lv8.
- Binary Shield
    - Gains <span class="greenText">Magi-Twister</span> at Lv6.
- Red Shield
    - Gains <span class="greenText">Anti-Fire</span> and <span class="greenText">Anti-Peck</span> at Lv8.

#### Bracelets

- Monster Detector (Monsterphobic)
    - Significantly lowers the difficulty of the dungeon.<br/>Field of view is limited in hallways on all floors, so this lets you avoid surprise attacks.<br/>Monsterphobic is still nice - be diligent about equipping and unequipping it.
- Item Detector (Itemphobic)
    - Makes exploring for items more efficient, and lets you detect shops at a glance.<br/>It's not a high priority compared to Monster Detector or Heal Bracelet, but it's nice to have.
- Cleansing Bracelet
    - Makes Mutaikon and Scorpion floors (11-12F) a non-issue.<br/>Otherwise it's not particulaly needed, but it can be nice for higher level Mutaikons<br/>if you haven't found Anti-Cnf. or Alert bracelets. (Mesmerikons don't spawn in this dungeon)
- Anti-Cnf. Bracelet
    - Protects against Blade Bee family and Dazikon special attacks, Spin Traps.<br/>Blocks Confused status caused by MC Mage and MC Wizard's magic bullets.<br/>It's fine to discard it after you're past Dazikon (35F) or MC Wizard (38F) floors.<br/>However, consider keeping it for its resonance effect if you're using a Baffle Axe.
- Alert Bracelet
    - Lets you safely defeat Naptapirs, and makes Dozikon floors (67-68F) far easier.<br/>It also protects against Sleep Traps, making it arguably the best status protection bracelet.
- Anti-Crs. Bracelet
    - Shop-exclusive. Protects against Curse Girl special attacks and Curse Traps.<br/>Keep it equipped on Horrabbit floors (56-58F) since Curspinsters spawn at the same time.
- Mojo Bracelet
    - Direct attacks and arrows gain a chance to deal critical hits.<br/>Using 2 bracelet resonance + 2 Mojo Bracelets is quite a unique and fun experience.
    - Critical hit rate increases by ~6% per cursed or sealed item in your inventory (not inside pots),<br/>so you need 18 items to reach 100%, or 9 items if using 2 bracelets.
    - It's safe to curse your equipment after you're finished synthesizing,<br/>and pots like Ordinary Pot and Black Hole Pot can be sealed without any drawbacks.
    - Exorcism Scroll has a chance to purify all items, so place non-target items down first.
- Can. Arm Bracelet
    - Shoot arrows or throw items like talismans or Gitan to clear out a line of enemies.
    - Use it with a Monster Detector or Navigation Scroll to snipe enemies from great distances,<br/>including monsters that are dangerous to go near like Porgon and Dozikon.
    - Nice for end game where you can stock up on Gitan by defeating Gitan Mamels and Ultra Gazers.
    - However, parried items will have piercing properties too, so keep it unequipped around<br/>Item Knave, Knave King, and Swordsman monsters.
- Strength Bracelet
    - Equip it if you don't have anything better on hand.<br/>It shines early game, but can be discarded if your inventory is getting hard to manage.
- Inacc. Bracelet
    - It lets you trap monsters.
    - Karakuroid floors turn into bonus zones, and you can even hunt Maneaters with it.
    - The most common use for it is to stock up on food using Decay Traps.
    - It's a bracelet that goes well with offensive playstyles, rather than defensive ones.
- Monster Summoner
    - It helps you maintain Super status, gain experience points, level equipment, and obtain item drops.
    - It's mostly only used when your attack power is buffed during Super status,<br/>but it can be used on Zalokleft floors if you have other ways to deal with extra enemies.
    - Equip 2 Monster Summoners to boost efficiency.
- Blink Bracelet
    - Nice if you have weak equipment, or don't have items to deal with a single room Monster House.
    - Don't rely on it too much, since when it activates and where you land is random.<br/>That said, it does help in emergencies or when searching for the stairs.
- Waterwalk Bracelet
    - Shop-exclusive. Lets you walk on water tiles.
    - Obtain island items, heal HP in waterways, ripen peaches, duplicate wet scrolls using Fever Pots.
    - Unequip it while standing on a water tile to warp to a random room.
    - Keep peaches, scrolls, and onigiri inside pots if you don't want them to get wet.
    - If a Bored Kappa throws a Hide Pot at you and you're on a water tile, you'll instantly collapse.
- Heal Bracelet
    - Shop-exclusive. Fullness depletion speeds up (x6.0), but you restore 3 HP per turn.
    - Greatly reduces the risk of being overwhelmed by spawns while stepping in place to heal HP.
    - Can be used to synthesize <span class="greenText">Healing</span>, but it's better to use the bracelet unless you're low on food.
- Identify Bracelet
    - Shop-exclusive. Incredibly useful if you find it, but also incredibly rare.
    - Use it to identify any and all items - staff uses, check if items are sealed, etc.
    - It's expensive and stealing may be unrealistic at times, but at least identify your current inventory.
- Wall Clip Bracelet
    - Elite Shop-exclusive. It's possibly the rarest bracelet in the dungeon.
    - Lets you attack through corners, escape situations, create safe spaces inside walls, etc.
    - Powerful on its own, but even better if used with 2 bracelet resonance and Monster Detector.

### Other Items

#### Projectiles

##### Arrows

If you're going to collect arrows, go with either <span class="purpleText">Knockback Arrows</span> or <span class="purpleText">Iron Arrows</span>.<br/>
Have Karakuroids create arrow traps early game, and use <span class="purpleText">Dodger Pot</span> + Boy Cart monsters mid game.<br/>Knockback Arrows are great against enemies like Absorbiphant who can only attack when adjacent.<br/><span class="purpleText">Poison Arrows</span> aren't bad either, but they don't work on Absorbiphants, and it's hard to collect lots of them.<br/><span class="purpleText">Killer Arrows</span> have 12% accuracy and are useless for defeating enemies, but can be used to trap monsters.<br/><span class="purpleText">Truestrike Arrows</span> and <span class="purpleText">Drain Arrows</span> are decent, but inventory space can be used for better items.

##### Rocks

<p>
  <span class="purpleText">Rocks</span> have a range of 3 tiles, and deal 12 damage. (<span class="purpleText">Porky Rocks</span> deal 20 damage)<br/>They make Cave Mamel and Gitan Mamel a non-issue, so it's nice to have them on hand.<br/>Traps can be triggered by thrown rocks, and they can be used to deal damage to enemies inside walls.<br/>Rocks are found in higher quantities than arrows, so use rocks first when performing Nigiri Morph Factory.<br/>It's best to only carry one type of rock to save inventory space.
</p>

#### Food

- Large Onigiri
    - Grilling it lowers the amount of fullness it replenishes (100 → 60), so keep it in a pot.
    - Having 2~3 of these on hand gives you peace of mind.
- Rotten Onigiri
    - Grill these to turn them into a respectable food item.
    - Created by triggering a Decay Trap while a monster is standing on the trap.
    - Inacc. Bracelet or Killer Arrow can be used to efficiently mass produce them.
    - Can be eaten to replenish 30 fullness if desperate - strength can be restored by eating a Peach.
- Grilled Onigiri
    - Replenishes 60 fullness and restores 40 HP.<br/>Its HP recovery isn't high enough for emergency use, but it's enough to top off after fights.<br/>Looking at it in the long run, it helps conserve higher quality healing items like Heal Pot.
- Hard Peach
    - It leaves a lot to be desired as a food item since it only replenishes 30 fullness.
    - However, 1 Hard Peach reduces damage received by 20%, which surpasses the <span class="greenText">Costly</span> rune.<br/>This damage reduction multiplier can be increased by eating additional Hard Peaches,<br/>and can be nice on floors where you expect to fight many enemies in a row.
- Peach
    - Replenishes 50 fullness, restores strength, and cures negative status conditions.
    - Grants Immune status when blessed, so don't let a blessed one ripen into a Juicy Peach.
    - Curing Muzzled status requires a Kappa throw, since you can't eat the Peach.
    - Having 1 on hand gives you peace of mind.
- Juicy Peach
    - Replenishes 100 fullness, making this the ideal peach if used solely as a food item.
    - Grants Enduring status, letting you survive a fatal hit with 1 HP remaining.<br/>However, keep in mind that Absorbiphants can absorb Enduring status.
- Rotten Peach
    - Replenishes 15 fullness, lowers attack and defense, and can't be grilled.
    - Reduced attack power and defense is a non-issue if you advance to the next floor right away,<br/>but you risk losing Super status if you eat it, so it's best to throw it at a strong enemy.

#### Pots

Item category that includes many extremely powerful effects.<br/>
Your ability to swiftly and accurately identify pots can make or break a run.<br/>
Pots can shatter even if they're sealed, so go ahead and seal full pots other than Preservation Pots<br/>if you have a Mojo Bracelet on hand to increase critical hit rate for free.

- Preservation Pot
    - Basic pot that expands inventory size and protects onigiri from spoiling.
    - Stop peaches from ripening, protect items from Gyadons, catch items thrown by Kappas, etc.
    - The more pots you have, the greater your chance of losing many items at once due to Nigiri Morph,<br/>Lv3-4 Gyadons and Field Knaves, so split important items across multiple pots instead of one pot.
- Synthesis Pot
    - Mixers are the main method of synthesis, so it's only used when the next Mixer zone is far away.
    - Use it to combine staves to free up inventory space in the second half.
    - It's fine to use it as an Ordinary Pot if you're struggling to carry items.
- Identify Pot
    - Prioritize inserting 3000G bracelets.
    - Once you've identified a decent number of items, it's fine to use it as an Ordinary Pot.
    - Don't underestimate the value of finding out how many uses a staff has left.
- Ordinary Pot
    - Use it as a container for items like synthesis ingredients, spare staves, and extra food.
    - Have a Scoopie fill it with dirt to obtain grass, if desired.
- Blessing Pot
    - Blank Scroll and Extraction Scroll are top priority.
    - 1 blessed Extraction Scroll can bless up to 5 items, so it's extremely powerful.
    - Other candidates include Revival or Undo grass, Peach, Upgrade Seed, or useful scrolls.
- Exorcism Pot
    - It can't purify cursed items you have equipped, so it's often just used as an Ordinary Pot.
- Presto Pot
    - Insert 1 rock or arrow at a time. Don't break it right away if you're low on inventory space.
    - The item table for Presto Pots is lackluster in Shiren 5 - It's mostly arrows, rocks, and food.
    - If it doesn't contain food, throw it at an enemy standing on a Decay Trap to get a Rotten Onigiri.
- Black Hole Pot
    - Incredible item that lets you escape dangerous situations or steal from shops risk-free.
    - Prioritize saving it for when you need to skip a floor or escape from a single room Monster House.
    - Seal it to prevent item loss due to Gazers, or capacity being reduced to 0 by Scoopies or Kappas.
    - Can be reused if you have an Extraction Scroll + Pot God Scroll on hand.
- Curse Pot
    - Turns into a positive item if you find a Mojo Bracelet.
    - Can be used as a container for synthesis ingredients if you have a way to purify the result,<br/>like synthesizing a non-cursed/sealed item last. (Mixer synthesis can have unexpected results)<br/>If an item already has a rune, trying to synthesize the same rune won't purify the item.
- Heal Pot
    - Reusable and powerful HP recovery item.
    - Can be used to restore strength and cure some negative status conditions.
    - The most common mistake players make is trying to save it until they "really need it",<br/>which results in it not being used when it could've saved a situation from deteriorating.
- Zalokleft Pot
    - Use it to steal from shops early game, break it and defeat Zaloklefts mid game.
    - It's a bit wasteful, but it can also be used as an Ordinary Pot if you're low on inventory space.
    - Can be used to obtain island items if the island is surrounded by water tiles.
- Hilarious Pot
    - Short duration and it's random when the laughter will spread, so not that great.
    - However, it's very effective against a single target, and can be sold for a decent amount.
- Water Pot
    - Shop-exclusive, but quite powerful.
    - Shuts down monsters like Shagga, Punisher, Pop Tank, and Karakuroid.
- Zen Pot
    - Designed to counter Abyssal Dragon and Cranky Tank.
    - Can be used on Archdragon and Ornery Tank floors if needed, and be careful of Scoopies.
    - It also nullifies Flame Shot, Dragon Grass, 4-2-8 Pot, Nonary Bracelet, other explosions.
    - Don't worry about carrying it all the way until the end if you find it near the start.
- Dodger Pot
    - One use is enough to obtain hundreds of Knockback Arrows and ensure a far easier run.
    - Counters Bored Kappa, Mutaikon, Porky, Scoopie monster special attacks.
    - Lets you trap monsters using traps created by Karakuroids.
    - Your projectiles also miss, so think before using it on Gitan Mamels and Kappa Troll floors.
- Perceptive Pot
    - Counters Zalokleft, Gyadon, Swordsman, and Field Knave monsters.
    - Unlike other fragrance pots, there's no drawbacks to consider when using this pot.
- Reflection Pot
    - Mainly used to counter MC Wizard, MC Sorceror, and Ultra Gazer.
    - Staves don't affect enemies while it's active, but the positives usually outweigh the negatives.
    - Knockback Staff can be used for movement, and Transient can be used to warp to the stairs.
    - Cranky Tank and Ultra Gazer overlap on 93F, and only 1 fragrance can be active at a time.
- Fever Pot
    - Shop-exclusive, and always has a capacity of 3 and a regular price of 1150 Gitan.
    - It's rare to find 3 of the same item in this dungeon, so players often duplicate talismans.
    - However, there's a trick to duplicate 1 scroll into 6 scrolls using Wet Scrolls,<br/>which is best used on Blank, Blessing, Fixer, Nixer, or Pot God scrolls.
- Upgrade Pot
    - Shop-exclusive. It's unreliable due to its random chance to shatter, but if it goes well, you can<br/>synthesize inserted weapons and shields into your main equipment for a significant stat boost.
    - The pot shatters if an inserted item reaches its upgrade limit, so insert Lv2\~3 equipment.
    - Prioritize inserting weapons if you managed to obtain a Day Shield.

#### Scrolls

This section only lists the scrolls that are worth carrying.

- Confusion Scroll
    - Inflicts Confused status on all enemies in the room for 20 turns.
    - Great option to help you escape emergencies like starting in a Monster House.
    - Having 1 on hand gives you peace of mind, though it's questionable if you need 2 or more.
- Slumber Scroll
    - Inflicts Sound Asleep status on all enemies in the room for 12 turns.
    - Quite a bit worse than Confusion Scroll, but usable if you don't have the latter on hand.
    - That said, it can be used like a Fear Scroll to safely defeat multiple adjacent enemies.
- Vacuum Slash Scrl
    - Only deals 40~44 damage, so it's not an emergency escape option starting from 12F or so.
    - Using 2 in a row wipes out most Lv1-3 monsters, and whatever survives can be finished in 1 hit,<br/>so if you have the inventory space for it, keeping 2 on hand isn't a bad option.
- Fixer Scroll
    - Fully restores HP, and grants an additional effect based on your current situation.
    - Its ability to purify equipped items is nice in particular, since you can't do so using Exorcism Pot.
- Exorcism Scroll
    - Guaranteed to purify a selected item, and has a chance to purify all inventory items.
    - This and Blessing Scroll are the only items that can purify pots, so keep it on hand if possible.
- Blessing Scroll
    - Powerful scroll that blesses a selected item.
    - If it's taking up space due to indecision, it's fine to use it on an item like a Peach or Fixer Scroll.
    - Another option is to simply keep it on hand as a substitute for Exorcism Scroll.
- Fate, Earth, Darth, Plating Scroll
    - Can be used as an Exorcism Scroll that only works on a weapon or shield.
    - Darth and Plating are a bit more valuable since they can be used on either category.
- Navigation Scroll
    - Reveals the map layout and locations of items, monsters, and stairs.
    - Helps ensure safety for the current floor, and is especially great for end game.
    - Can be used to make it easier to hunt enemies like Zaloklefts and Maneaters.
- Pot God Scroll
    - Powerful scroll that increases the capacity of a selected pot by 1.
    - Good options include Heal, Dodger, Zen, Reflection, and Preservation pots.
    - It's the only way to recover a fragrance pot that was reduced to 0 capacity by a Scoopie.
- Immunity Scroll
    - Protects you from all ailments, and is used to synthesize <span class="greenText">Anti-Blast※</span> (Nullifies explosions).
    - Beginners usually read or discard this scroll right away, but it really should be saved.
- Sanctuary Scroll
    - It doesn't protect you from all attacks, but it's fantastic when the situation allows for it.
    - Use it to safely synthesize on Mixermon floors + gain experience points and skill points.
- Nixer Scroll
    - Essentially a 50% chance to flip the dungeon's balance on its head.
    - Use it on Porkys or Dragons to turn Porgon, Archdragon, Abyssal Dragon floors into bonus zones.
    - Some players write Nixer on any Blank Scrolls they obtain without a second thought,<br/>since it's possible to get the Blank Scroll back from a Monster License when changing floors.
- Extinction Scroll
    - Throw it at a monster to make that monster family not spawn for the remainder of the adventure.
    - Consider saving it until you get close to dangerous floors instead of throwing it right away.
    - Good options include Dragon, Fearabbit, Pop Tank, Porky, and Gazer.
- Blank Scroll
    - Shop-exclusive, but can be obtained from Presto Pots on very rare occasions.
    - It's easy to let this go unused in your inventory, forever saving it until you "really need it".
    - Popular options include Extinction, Coupon, and Desert (<span class="greenText">Anti-Aquatic</span>) or Lost (<span class="greenText">Bored</span>) for synthesis.
    - If you find a Fever Pot, use the Wet Scroll duplication trick to create 6 Blank Scrolls.
