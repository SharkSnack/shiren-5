# Overview

First off, Shiren 5 is a traditional roguelike game.

- Tile-based movement and turn-based combat.
- Player level and stats reset between each adventure.
- You'll lose all items and money if you collapse.

That sounds a bit intimidating, but the game also features support systems.

- Allies who keep their level ups between each adventure.
- Equipment tags so that you can reclaim lost weapons or shields.
- Storehouse and bank to keep important items and money safe.
- Point shop that makes it easy to obtain revival or escape items.
- Side content to play as practice if the main story is too hard at first.

It can feel luck-based and unfair at first, but that's because you lack knowledge and experience.<br/>
The game pushes you in the direction of growing as a player, rather than grinding until you win like a JRPG.<br/>If you stick with it, you'll find that it's a very rewarding gameplay experience.

#### Ouma Shrine

1. Read what Koppa has to say as you progress through the dungeon.

#### Nekomaneki Village

1. Go to the basement of Hotel Nekomaneki to view an event and receive items.
    - Encyclopedia - Records items you've obtained, and monsters you've defeated.
    - Secret Pots unlocked - Needed to create [New Items](/system/new-items).
        - This is an optional gameplay system that can be ignored for now.
2. Go to the Point Shop and talk to Pointman to receive a [Point Card](/system/gameplay-basics#point-card).
    - The Point Shop is located to the left of the Dungeon Center.
    - Carry this card and step on Point Switches to collect points, which can be exchanged for items.
        - Undo Grass costs 70 points, and is used to either revive or escape with your items and money.

### Destiny Trail ~ Tower of the Past

<div class="relativeImage smallScreenshot">
  <img src="../images/overworld/destiny_trail.jpg"/>
</div>

Details about [Destiny Trail](/dungeons/destiny-trail) and [Tower of the Past](/dungeons/tower-of-the-past) can be found on their respective dungeon pages.<br/>For now, the focus will be getting used to how the game plays.

#### Basics

1. The player and monsters take turns. Turn ending actions include:
    - Attacking
    - Moving
    - Using an item
    - Talking to a NPC
2. HP regenrates only when you move or step in place.
    - Step in place: Press B + A at the same time.
3. The player gets hungry as he performs actions, depleting fullness. (FG gauge)
    - Fullness decreases by 1 every 10 turns.
    - Once fullness reaches 0, you'll take 1 damage per turn.
    - Fullness can be replenished by eating onigiri, peach or grass items.
4. Diagonal movement is equal to 2 orthogonal movements.
    - Hold R to guarantee diagonal movement.
    - Diagonal movement is key to conserving fullness and fleeing from enemies.
5. Hold B and move to perform a fast dash.
    - Turns pass like normal while dashing, so it can be risky if there are strong enemies around.
    - You can also hold B and move toward an item to step on it without picking it up.
6. Sort items in your inventory by pressing the Y button.
    - Gitan (money) and projectiles will become stacked if applicable.
7. Rocks, arrows, staves, or talismans can be "Set" from the item menu.
    - This lets you use the item by pressing L instead of having to open the menu.
8. Insert onigiri and peaches into Preservation Pots to keep them safe from spoiling.
    - Peaches ripen as you advance floors. (Hard Peach → Peach → Juicy Peach → Rotten Peach)
9. Equip weapons to raise attack power, and shields to raise defense.
    - Shiren's defense doesn't increase from leveling up.
10. Weapons and shields gain skill points when you defeat monsters using direct attacks.
    - Once the bar is full, the piece of equipment will level up and become stronger.
        - Attack or defense might increases.
        - Upgrade limit increases.
        - Rune slots might increase.

#### Combat

1. Lure enemies toward you by performing a direct attack instead of stepping toward them.
    - This avoids letting enemies get the first hit.
    - Some enemies have long-ranged attacks, so you'll want to zigzag against those.
2. If there are multiple enemies in the room, retreat into a hallway and fight them 1 vs 1.
3. If your HP is getting low, go ahead and retreat for a bit before continuing the fight.
    - If you're sandwiched by 2 enemies, consider using an item.
4. Don't hesitate to use items. You'll lose all items if you collapse, so don't be stingy.
    - Herb, Otogiriso, and Heal Grass can be used when your HP is full to increase max HP.
    - Weapons and shields you don't need can be thrown to deal damage from a distance.
    - Gitan bags can be thrown to deal (Gitan value / 10) points of damage.
    - Staves can be thrown to get one last use out of them even when remaining uses is 0.
5. If you're one hit away from collapsing, you need to use an item.
    - Gambling on a direct attack or projectile is a sure way to end up collapsed.
        - The player's direct attacks have 92\~95% accuracy, based on weapon level.
        - Projectiles have 84% accuracy.
6. If there's a tough enemy coming your way, soften it with projectiles.
    - Deal enough damage so that one direct attack finishes it off.
    - However, if your HP is full, consider fighting it normally to conserve items.

#### Other

1. If you linger on a floor for a very long time, [Wind of Kron](/system/dungeon-features#wind-of-kron) will begin to blow.
    - If you get blown away by the wind, you'll lose all items and money, as if you collapsed.
    - The wind gusts 3 times as warnings before finally blowing the player away.
        1. You feel the wind picking up.
        2. The wind blows harder.
        3. The wind gusts vigorously!
2. [Traps](/system/traps) can be hidden in the ground, and trigger when you step onto the tile.
    - Trip Traps can cause pots to break, so it's good to carry a Balance Staff if you find one.
3. Wandering NPCs can be found at times, and offer items or services to help you out.
    - See [NPCs](/system/npcs) for details.
4. Items can be [blessed, cursed, or sealed](/system/gameplay-basics#blessing-/-curse-/-seal).
    - Blessed items have stronger effects.
    - Cursed equipment can't be unequipped.
    - Sealed items can't be used.
    - Curses and seals can be removed using items like Exorcism Scroll, Exorcism Pot, etc.
    - Curses and seals can also be removed by the Curse Breaker in Nekomaneki Village.
5. Allies and NPCs always dodge flying equipment.
    - It's safe to fight Swordsman with your back against an ally.
6. If Jirokichi collapses and you try to advance, you'll return to Nekomaneki Village.
    - You'll keep all of your items and money when this happens.

### Tower of the Present ~ Tower of the Future

<div class="relativeImage smallScreenshot">
  <img src="../images/overworld/tower_of_the_present.jpg"/>
</div>

Details about [Tower of the Present](/dungeons/tower-of-the-present) and [Tower of the Future](/dungeons/tower-of-the-future) can be found on their respective dungeon pages.<br/>For now, the focus is still getting used to how the game plays.

#### Basics

1. Monsters that decrease strength begin to appear.
    - Strength affects damage dealt by the player's direct attacks and arrows.
    - Damage output changes on even numbered strength values.
        - Example: 8 strength and 9 strength are effectively the same.
2. A monster called [Foly](/system/monsters#foly) appears, and often serves as a bit of a wall for newcomers.
    - Only 1 Foly can spawn at a time, so paralyzing it makes it a non-issue for the current floor.
    - Its ability changes based on its body color.
        - Red: Reflects direct attacks.
        - Blue: 15 damage lightning to all creatures in the room.
        - Green: Heals the player's HP after being hit by their direct attack.
        - Purple: Counters with a negative status condition.
    - Foly floors
        - Tower of the Future: 4\~6F.

#### Synthesis

- A monster called [Mixer](/system/monsters#mixer) appears, and can be used to [synthesize](/system/gameplay-basics#synthesis) items.
    - This is an extremely important mechanic to understand and utilize.
    - Basically, throw 2 items at it to combine items, and then defeat it to collect the result.
        - See the above link for details, and the [Runes](/system/synthesis-runes) pages for a list of recipes.
    - Mixer floors
        - Tower of the Present: 1\~3F.
        - Tower of the Future: 4\~5F.

### Hermit's Hermitage and Beyond

<div class="relativeImage smallScreenshot">
  <img src="../images/overworld/tower_of_fortune.jpg"/>
</div>

See [Villages](/system/villages#hermit's-hermitage) for details about available facilities.

#### Basics

1. [Equipment tags](/system/gameplay-basics#equipment-tags) can now be placed on weapons or shields at shops for 3,000 Gitan each.
    - If you lose a tagged item, it'll be delivered to the Sentry in Hermit's Hermitage.
        - Basically a way to ensure you don't permanently lose your main weapon or shield.
        - You'll occasionally need to pay some Gitan to pick the item up.
    - However, there are some cases where a tagged item won't be delivered.
        - Item was turned into an onigiri or Weeds due to a monster's special attack.
        - Item was inserted into a Presto or Sale pot.
        - Quit the game without suspending properly / game froze.
2. Equipment can be [upgraded](/system/gameplay-basics#equipment-upgrade-value) at the Blacksmith.
    - You need to give the NPC a Juicy Peach to unlock his services.
    - The blacksmith can also erase unwanted runes.
3. As you defeat enemies, you might gain [Super](/system/gameplay-basics#super-status) status.
    - Basically, you gain an attack power boost + other special effects.

#### Night

- From this point onward, time of day will begin to cycle.
    - Current monsters vanish, and new monsters spawn when time of day changes.
        - Day to night: Day monsters vanish, and night monsters are generated.
        - Night to day: Night monsters vanish, and day monsters are generated.
    - Night characteristics
        - Night monsters only take 1 damage from attacks other than [abilities](/system/necklace-abilities).
            - Up to 8 abilities can be assigned, and each ability can only be used 1 time per floor.
            - You can refresh abilities by eating a peach item, or by reading a Replenish Scroll.
        - Field of view is reduced to a 1 tile radius, but can be expanded by equipping a torch.
            - Night monsters deal more damage to you if you don't have a torch equipped.
    - Day characteristics
        - Everything functions the same as you experienced up to this point.
            - Abilities cannot be used during the day.
    - Tip: If you don't have a torch, enter a hallway and step in place until it becomes daytime.
        - Wandering around without a light source is a sure way to collapse.

At this point, you should have a decent grasp of gameplay mechanics.<br/>
Continue onward at your own pace, and don't forget that you can buy Undo Grass at the Point Shop.
