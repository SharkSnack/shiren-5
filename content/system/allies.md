metaDescription: "List of allies and their characteristics for Shiren the Wanderer 2: Oni Invasion!"
---

Allies are NPC characters who fight monsters alongside Shiren.<br/>
Shiren 5 features six ally characters - Jirokichi, Tao, Okon, Koharu, and Gen.<br/>
Each character comes with a unique ability, and can grow stronger through leveling up.

Those looking for a more classic roguelike experience can leave everyone except Jirokichi<br/>
behind during the main story, but considering most post-game dungeons don't allow allies,<br/>
it might be fun to experience them and see their abilities while you can.

## Overview

Allies must be unlocked before they can join your adventures.<br/>
The unlock conditions are generally pretty lax, with some characters simply joining<br/>
you automatically when you reach certain points of the main story.

Level ups for allies persist between adventures.<br/>
Due to this, they typically require more experience points to level up.<br/>
It's best to use items like Cheery Grass or Angel Seed to level them up once they reach high levels.

Turn order: Shiren → Allies → Monsters.

All allies except for Kojirouta prioritize following Shiren.<br/>
They won't attack monsters who aren't an immediate threat.<br/>(Example: Napping or paralyzed monsters)

Press Select (- or ZL on Nintendo Switch) to view their current HP.<br/>
You can also talk to them to get a rough idea, but keep in mind that talking is a turn ending action.<br/>

If an ally is defeated, the monster that defeated the ally levels up.<br/>

Experience points are distributed to all party members regardless of who defeated the monster.<br/>The amount of experience points doesn't change based on number of party members.

Allies follow you when you switch places with a wandering NPC.<br/>
Doors wait to close until Shiren and all allies pass through the door.<br/>
However, blue doors still close immediately if a monster is present in the room you enter.

Except for Kojirouta, allies follow you to the next floor even if you were in different rooms.<br/>Levels can be gained or lost by level-changing items such as Cheery Grass or Unlucky Staff.<br/>Koharu and allies who are in wandering NPC mode aren't affected.<br/>

The most efficient way to level up allies:

1. Use Fever Pots and blessed Extraction Scrolls to prepare lots of blessed Angel Seeds.
    - Alternatively, register an Angel Seed as a New Item, and then purchase a bunch of that item.
2. Equip a Can. Arm Bracelet and enter a dungeon with 3 allies.
3. Line them up in a hallway and throw the Angel Seeds.

Herb, Otogiriso, Heal Grass, and Life Grass will restore HP when thrown at an ally.<br/>
Max HP won't increase when they're at full HP.

They dodge flying equipment, include equipment disarmed by a Swordsman's special attack.<br/>
The number of allies you can have with you depends on the dungeon, but it's usually 3 characters.

## Characters

</div>

#### Location

- No permanent location.
- Automatically joins when you reach the first 3 towers. (Past, Present, or Future)
    - Mandatory ally during the main story.
        - This means only 2 other allies can join you during the main story.

- Permanently becomes unavailable as an ally after clearing the main story.
    - However, he can be recruited in Garden of Destiny (Switch/Steam exclusive),<br/>so it may be worth leveling him during the main story.

- He transforms into a gravestone when he collapses.
    - Revive him by throwing an item like Herb, Otogiriso, Heal Grass, Life Grass,<br/>Heal Pot (with at least 1 capacity), Revival Grass, or Undo Grass.

- The gravestone is treated as a NPC.
    - You can switch places with the gravestone, and enemies can't move through it.
- Advancing while Jirokichi is a gravestone returns you to Nekomaneki Village.

### Okon

<div class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/ally/okon.png"/>
</div>

#### How to Unlock

1. Help the trapped fox when you randomly encounter it inside a dungeon.
    - The event will occur again later if you decide not to help the fox.
2. Return to Nekomaneki Village.

#### Location

Next to the Lot Shop. (Basement of Hotel Nekomaneki)

#### Characteristics

- Low HP and collapses extremely easily.
    - Expect her to collapse if you get separated from her.
- Transforms into a monster and uses its special attack.
    - Talk to Okon to enable/disable specific transformations.
    - She'll learn new transformations as she levels up.
    - Guaranteed to transform if the special attack will work.
        - Example: An enemy is adjacent → Transforms into Gazer and confuse them.

Transformation List:

|Lv|Monster|Effect|
|-|-|-|
|1|Blade Bee|Retreat 1 tile after attacking.|
|5|Gazer|Inflicts Confused status to a monster in front.|
|9|Moseal|Body slams a monster either to the north or south.|
|14|DJ Mage|Fires a magic bullet in a straight line that either knocks a target back,<br/>or warps them to a different location on the same floor.|
|20|Curse Girl|Inflicts Sealed status to a monster in front.|
|27|Scoopie|Inflicts Blind status from a distance.<br/>However, it can miss, and Flamebirds burn the dirt on contact.|
|35|Grass Boy|Throws a random grass with piercing properties.<br/>It can miss, and it won't hit Shiren if he's visible to Okon.|
|44|Absorbiphant|Cures ailments for allies, and erases enemy auras and positive effects.<br/>Okon's HP will be fully restored, and she'll gain the Buffed status.|
|54|Naptapir|Infclits Asleep status to all monsters within a 1 tile radius.|
|65|Flamebird|Restores 30 HP when Shiren, an ally, or Okon has Danger status.|

#### Tips

Generally, it's dangerous for her to have many transformations enabled at the same time,<br/>since the AI might choose to an attacking transformation instead of one that disables<br/>an adjacent enemy.

If you're worried, it's best to only leave Naptapir (or Gazer) enabled for general play,<br/>and toggle other transformations for one turn as needed.

- Blade Bee is her main method to deal with Gyazas and Absorbiphants.
- Gazer is necessary to win (or even survive) 1-vs-1 fights until she learns Naptapir.
- Moseal should be disabled at all times, since it places her away from Shiren.
- DJ Mage can be handy to avoid fights at night or in single-room Monster Houses.
- Curse Girl should be disabled at all times, since Okon will easily collapse if she's attacked.
- Scoopie is excellent at disabling enemies in rooms, though note that it can miss.
- Grass Boy is a decent long range option, but enemies can level up if she throws Rage Grass.
    - Throws Poison, Confusion, Sleepy, Blinding, Rage, Dragon, Amnesia, or Warp grass.
- Absorbiphant offers fantastic support for Shiren, and greatly increases Okon's offense.
- Naptapir should be enabled at all times, since it completely shuts down most enemies.
    - Except when fighting Gyazas, since they convert the effect into 2 damage.
- Flamebird should be used to restore HP after a fight, rather than enabling it while fighting.

Guiding the sage to Hermit's Hermitage unlocks a side quest to learn Staccato Wave.

Guiding the sparrow unlocks the Sparrow NPC.

- Offers to heal you for 500G when you're in danger.
- The event only occurs in dungeons that have wandering NPCs.
