## Questions & Answers

### How do I play Shiren 2 in English?

The English patch created by ozidual and sharksnack hasn't been released yet.<br/>
If you're interested in testing, join the <a href="https://discord.gg/5y7UDFc">Shiren the Wanderer</a> Discord server for details.

### How do I provide feedback?

Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/5y7UDFc">Shiren the Wanderer</a> Discord server and post in #shiren-2 (under Patch Feedback).

Save state usage can cause issues due to the way the game constantly writes,<br/>so don't bother reporting errors if you use save states.

### Does this game run on X device?

The English patch has been tested on the following:

- Real Hardware (Nintendo 64)
- Project64 (Windows 10)
- RetroArch (Nintendo Switch)

Anything not in the above list is untested, and you're on your own.

### Fix for graphics issues in Project64?

Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/5y7UDFc">Shiren the Wanderer</a> Discord server and check the #announcements channel.

### Anything I should know before playing?

1. This game is a prequel to Shiren 1, and is the first game in the timeline.<br/>That said, each game in the series features a self-contained story, so you don't<br/>need to have played other games in the series to understand and enjoy the story.

2. There's a glitch that hard-locks the game, so it's recommended to read through the Glitches page.<br/>This glitch is in the original ROM, and wasn't introduced by the English patch.

3. Asuka and Mamo will lose their items if [Return to Napus Village] is selected at the main menu.<br/>
This applies even if Asuka and Mamo weren't brought along for the current adventure.<br/>
If you don't want them to lose their items, don't select [Return to Napus Village].<br/>
However, if the game freezes, you can't avoid having to select [Return to Napus Village].<br/>
So to be safe, keep important items in storage, rather than having Asuka or Mamo carry them.<br/>
Copying a journal will also delete Asuka and Mamo's items in the copy.

4. Save state usage can cause issues due to the way the game constantly writes.<br/>If your save file gets corrupted or game progression breaks as a result of using save states,<br/>don't bother reporting it as a problem with the English patch.

### Does the Healing Sword seal stack?

No, the 回 seal (Healing Sword) does not stack. Only synthesize it 1 time.

### Does the Otogiriso seal stack?

Yes, synthesizing multiple 弟 seals (Otogiriso) increases the amount of HP restored.<br/>
The effect is separate from the 回 seal, so they can be used together.

### Do seals need to be adjacent to stack?

No, the order of seals doesn't matter for stacked effects.

### Where can I find Perfect Wood?

Perfect Wood can only be found in the 2nd half of Shuten Trail Mid (8\~12F).<br/>
It can't be found in Shuten Trail Hard.

### Which monster should I capture in Road to the End?

It's best to capture an Armordillo family monster so that you can collect lots of items.<br/>
This strategy takes a long time, but it's one of the most consistent ways to clear Road to the End.

However, Armordillo monsters are rather weak and prone to accidents, so it's a good idea<br/>to capture a second one if you happen to come across a second Monster Pot.<br/>
Armordillo Pop is ideal, but an Armordillo Bro can be used if you're careful.

Other notable monsters include Monsoon Doll, Gazelle Pope, Hyper Gazer, and Shihan.

### Are upgrade value and seals lost when making Fiery Fuuma?

Yes, upgrade value and seals will be lost when the Katana+99 turns into a Fiery Fuuma.

This is also the case when the following weapons or shields are created:<br/>
Kaburasutegi, Daisangen Sword, Ryujin Sword, Wonder Pick, Healing Sword,<br/>
Helix Shield, Daisangen Shield, Nirvana Shield.
