## Overview

New Items is a feature where you use a base item to create an item with added abilities.<br/>To be clear, it's not the same as item synthesis.

## About

### Characteristics

- Weapons and shields can't level up, even if the base item wasn't Lv8.
- New Items can't be used as secondary items for sysnthesis.<br/>(Weapons and shields can still be used as a base)
- When a New Item is thrown, each of the item's effects will hit the target individually.<br/>(Example: Scroll with 4 effects that aren't Extinction or Exorcism → deal 2 damage four times)
- New Items can't be inserted into secret pots.

### Pros and Cons

The best way to enjoy both worlds is to create 2 save files - 1 with New Items, and 1 without.

Pros:

- Easily obtain powerful items.
- Simplifies tasks like leveling up allies to Lv99.
- Warp to the stairs by swinging a staff to quickly dive in dungeons.<br/>(Example: Save time when running Catstones for wishes in Inori Cave)

Cons:

- If too strong of an item is created and chosen, the balance of a dungeon can be ruined.<br/>※ Especially for Old Road and Heavenly Lake, which don't allow carry-in items.
- Once registered, New Items can't be erased until you exceed 64 items.<br/>(Oldest registered New Item is deleted when you register a 65th item)
- If you're interested in speedrunning, New Items aren't allowed.


### Creating New Items

Insert an item into a secret pot located in the basement of Hotel Nekomaneki,<br/>
and then wait until the next day for random abilities to get added.

- If you like the added abilities, take the item out.
- If you don't like the added abilities, leave the item in the pot.

The abilities are added at midnight, and change each day for 7 days.<br/>
Once it reaches day 8, the item turns into Weeds.

New Items can be created from weapons, shields, bracelets, grass, staves, scrolls, and talismans.<br/>
Other categories like pots, food, arrows, rocks, and torches can't be inserted into secret pots.

New Items are automatically registered when they're taken out of a secret pot,<br/>and up to 64 items can be registered at a time.<br/>

<span class="orangeText">Registered items can't be erased</span>, with the exception of the oldest item being erased<br/>when you exceed the 64 item registration limit.

They appear in some dungeons that don't allow carry-in items, so they can be a balance breaker.<br/>
Therefore, it's recommended to make 2 save files - 1 with New Items, and 1 without.

### Unlocking Secret Pots

Two secret pots are unlocked after the Ponta (Lot Shop) event for all versions.<br/>The maximum number of secret pots is 6.

#### PS Vita / Switch / Steam

1. Clear the main story.
2. Talk to Ponta and select "Special" to unlock 4 additional secret pots.

#### DS

1. Streetpass 5 people to unlock 1 additional secret pot.
2. Repeat step 1 until all 4 additional secret pots are unlocked.<br/>(It's possible to repeatedly Streetpass the same person)

### Purchasing

Talk to Ponkichi near the secret pots to purchase New Items you've registered.<br/>
You can only purchase 1 item at a time, and must enter a dungeon to purchase another item.

Staves are always sold with a use count of 4, and talismans are always sold in a set of 2.

The price varies a bit based on the added abilities or effects, but generally uses<br/>the inserted item's value as a base.
Lastly, all New Items have a selling price of 10 Gitan.

### New Items in Dungeons

Some dungeons have New Items enabled, meaning you can find New Items within the dungeon.

6 items are randomly selected from your encyclopedia and get added to the item table,<br/>and the New Item is treated as a separate item than the item that was used as a base<br/>when creating the New Item.<br/>

The selected New Items can be generated either on the ground, or as merchandise in stores.

New Items seem to have their own item table category, and any item can<br/>appear at any point in the dungeon regardless of the base item's rarity.<br/>
(Example: Scout Bracelet or Angel Seed based New Item can appear in Destiny Trail)

As you can imagine, this can break the balance of any dungeon that has New Items enabled.<br/>Dungeons that have New Items enabled include Old Road, Heavenly Lake,<br/>and all dungeons that allow carry-in items.

## Mechanics

### Stats and Abilities

This section offers details on how stats and abilities are added as days pass.

- The base item's upgrade value, runes, use count, blessing, etc. are ignored.<br/>Stats and abilities are returned to their base values the moment the item is inserted.
- The added abilities are selected at random, and some are more common than others.
    - This can be seen when you insert bracelets, where cheaper abilities like Bunch<br/>or Can. Arm are common, but expensive ones like Wall Clip or VIP are rare.
- Scrolls and staves have ability categories, and only same category abilities will get added.
    - Scrolls are split into selection and non-selection abilities.<br/>Effects like Fate Scroll never get added to a base item that doesn't have a selection<br/>such as Confusion Scroll, and selection scrolls only gain selection abilities.
    - Staves are split into those that fire magic bullets, and those that don't.<br/>Staves that fire magic bullets only gain abilities that fire magic bullets, and vice versa.
- The number of added abilities can increase as days pass, up to a max of 3 abilities.
    - The number of added abilities will never decrease as days pass.
    - Multiple abilities can get added in a single day.<br/>(Example: 2 days without any abilities, and then suddenly gain 3 abilities the next day)
- Many added abilities are based on existing items, but some are exclusive to New Items.
    - Some existing item abilities never get added to New Items, such as Floating Bracelet.
    - So for example, if you want a New Item bracelet with the Floating Bracelet effect,<br/>you have to insert a Floating Bracelet into the secret pot.
- Weapon and shield stats have variance.
    - Base attack or defense can have a max increase of +15.
    - Upgrade limit and rune slot count are included in this variance.
    - There are 6 outcomes when it rolls for stats, and they never get worse as days pass.<br/>(Bad, Bad Rare, Normal, Normal Rare, Good, Good Rare)
    - If the previous day rolled Bad, the next day can roll:<br/>→ Bad, Bad Rare, Normal, Normal Rare, Good, or Good Rare.
    - If the previous day rolled Normal, the next day can roll:<br/>→ Normal, Normal Rare, Good, or Good Rare.
    - If the previous day rolled Normal Rare, the next day can roll:<br/>→ Normal Rare or Good Rare.
    - ※ Upgrade limit and rune count have ranges for each roll rather than set values,<br/>so you might see them decrease the next day.
    - For example, Ordinary Stick's upgrade value: Bad = 50~55, Normal = 53~58.<br/>If you roll Bad and get 55, and then roll a Normal and get 53 the next day,<br/>the value decreased despite being a better roll.
    - Bad, Normal, and Good rolls are shared between base attack or defense,<br/>upgrade limit, rune slot count, and ability count.
    - On the other hand, base attack or defense, upgrade limit, and rune count<br/>have their own rolls for Rare.
    - For ability count, Bad = 0~1, Normal = 2, and Good = 3.
    - The chance for better rolls increases as days pass.
    - Inserting higher level equipment also boosts the chance for better rolls.
- Possible values for weapon and shield stats are based on level, so always insert Lv8.
- Resonance is based on the base item.<br/>(Example: Strength Bracelet as a base, resonates with Counter Shield)
- Inserting a Fixer Scroll as a base lets you read the New Item scroll without light at night.

## Popular Items

Some players limit the number of items they create to 6 to ensure they're available in a run.<br/>Keep in mind that this section is an opinion piece, so it's not definitive.

#### Transient Staff + "Switch places with your target"

- Swing at an enemy or NPC to warp Shiren to the stairs.
- Useful for escaping bad situations, rushing stairs, stealing, etc.
- Save time when running Catstones for wishes in Inori Cave.
- Makes bringing Kojirouta to the top of Tower of Miracles trivial.
- Even better if you get Clone + Balance as 3rd and 4th abilities.

#### Fixer Scroll + Mnster House Scrl + Expulsion or Night-Day

- Good combination on paper, but actually not that great.
    - Pros:
        - Fixer Scroll as a base lets you read it at night without light.
        - Create and wipe out a Monster House to obtain some items.
        - Better if you also get Trap Deletion or Collection for 4th ability.
    - Cons:
        - If there already was a Monster House, the next floor turns into a single room MH.
        - The generated items are floor table items, so not the best quality.
        - By the time you've made other New Items, you likely won't care about floor items.

#### Bracelet

<span class="highlightPurple">Base Bracelet:</span>

- Floating Bracelet
    - Floating Bracelet's ability can never be added, so only insert this bracelet.

<span class="highlightRed">Best:</span>

    - Only prevents level, max HP, max strength, and max fullness from decreasing.<br/>To be clear, you're still susceptible to all status conditions / ailments.

#### Weapon

<span class="highlightPurple">Base Weapon:</span>

- Shugoseki Swd
    - Strongest weapon that activates 2 bracelet resonance.
- Starcutter
    - For those that don't care for Flame Shot.
    - Targite is more common than Red Shield, which makes it more likely you'll be able<br/>to activate 2 bracelet resonance in dungeons that don't allow carry-in items.
- Gitan Gorger
    - Inferior to 2 bracelet resonance, so not recommended.
    - If you want the highest raw damage output in the game.
    - Aim for the "Makes Gitan drop easier" ability.
- Kaburasutegi
    - Inferior to 2 bracelet resonance, so not recommended.
    - Perhaps try to tailor it to fighting night monsters with Helix Shield?
        - Fullness raises your critical hit chance
        - May defeat targets in one blow
        - May allow you to attack 2 times

<span class="highlightRed">Best:</span>

- Direct attacks will always connect (Accurate)
- Fullness raises your critical hit chance
    - Formula: (Max fullness - Current fullness) * 100%<br/>Examples: Fullness 90/100 = 90%, Fullness 12/200 = 6%.
    - 100% critical hit rate if you have a Nirvana Board equipped. (<span class="greenText">Unfamished</span>)

<span class="highlightYellow">Good:</span>

- Increases experience points earned
    - Earn +15% experience points when defeating monsters.<br/>Stacks with the x2.5 multiplier in Garden of Destiny for a total multiplier of x2.875.

<span class="highlightBlue">Avoid:</span>

- May defeat targets in one blow
    - Only 8% chance to take effect. (However, it can one-shot night monsters)
    - Basically nullifies <span class="greenText">Healing</span> and <span class="greenText">Dispersing</span> when it takes effect.

#### Shield

<span class="highlightPurple">Base Shield:</span>

- Shugoseki Shld
    - Strongest shield that activates 2 bracelet resonance.
- Galaxy Guard
    - For those that don't care for Flame Shot.
    - Bladite is more common than Red Blade, which makes it more likely you'll be able<br/>to activate 2 bracelet resonance in dungeons that don't allow carry-in items.
- Daytime Queen
    - Inferior to 2 bracelet resonance, so not recommended.
    - If you want the highest raw damage reduction in the game.
- Helix Shield
    - Inferior to all of the above options, so not recommended.

<span class="highlightRed">Best:</span>

- Reflects magic bullets, hypnosis, dance
    - The magic bullet is reflected, so you don't take damage like Swap Shield.
- All projectiles aimed at you will miss

<span class="highlightYellow">Good:</span>

- May be upgraded when you are attacked
    - 12% chance to increase upgrade value by 1 when hit.
    - Broken ability in dungeons that don't allow carry-in items.
- Stepping on traps doesn't set them off

    - Unnecessary if you have a Floating Bracelet.

    - Nice against Shopkeeper, Bashagga, Gitan Mamel, etc.
- May reflect an attack back
    - Potentially one-shot limit broken monsters.
- May reflect back flame breaths
    - Nice for dungeons that have lots of Archdragon and Abyssal Dragon floors.
- Grants immunity to explosive damage
    - Can be hard to synthesize in a run.

<span class="highlightBlue">Avoid:</span>

- Clears Berserk status
    - The only way to prevent Berserk status, but the 2 abilities in the Best category<br/>shut down Mesmerikon and MC Wizard special attacks, so it's unnecessary.

## Abilities

Many New Item abilities are based on exisiting items.<br/>
When you check a secret pot, the items the abilities are based on get added to your Item Book.<br/>
(Example: Insert an Herb, "Increases max HP" gets added, Life Grass is added to Item Book)<br/>
It's great way to register rare items, and you don't need to register the New Item for it to work.

### Weapon

The abilities that are based on existing runes have the exact same effect.<br/>
(See [Runes](/system/synthesis-runes#weapon) for details.)

## Cheating

The idea is to adjust console time to skip having to wait until the next day in real time.<br/>(Shiren 5 is primarily a single-player game, so you'd only be souring your own experience)

### Switch

It's possible to change the date while playing, including advancing and returning to previous dates.<br/>(System Settings → System → Date and Time)

Example:

1. Insert an item on 7/10.
2. While the game is running, change date to 7/17 in settings → check the secret pot.<br/>
3. If you don't like the result, you can go back 1 day and check the secret pot on 7/16.
4. Repeat all the way back to 7/11 if you want.<br/>
5. If you feel like the result on 7/14 was the best, change the date back to 7/14 and register it.
6. If you didn't like any of them, return to 7/11 and take out the item. (If unchanged).

If any of the dates of inserted items go in the negative, all items turn into Weeds,<br/>so it's best to insert items at the same time, rather than inserting across different dates.

If you don't mind more blatant cheating, you can back up your save data before inserting items.<br/>This lets you retry without having to spend time leveling equipment or reaquiring rare items.<br/>(Requires NSO subscription)

Steps:

1. System Settings → Data Management → Save Data Cloud → (Select profile).
2. Settings → Advanced Save-Data Settings → Set "Shiren the Wanderer: The..." to Off.
3. Return to home menu, highlight Shiren and press "+" → Save Data Cloud → (Select profile)
4. Back Up Save Data (Before inserting items into secret pots!)
5. Start the game and insert items → adjust clock to check 7 days worth of items.
6. If you didn't see anything you want to keep:
    - Return to home menu, highlight Shiren and press "+" → Save Data Cloud → (Select profile).<br/>Download Save Data and try again. (May need to adjust clock and back up save data again)

It seems it's possible to manipulate the clock like Switch / PS Vita.<br/>Save data is apparently stored in: \Steam\userdata\99999999\1178790\remote.<br/>(Where '99999999' is your user ID)

### PS Vita

It's possible to change the date while playing, including advancing and returning to previous dates.

Example:

1. Insert an item on 7/10.
2. While the game is running, press the PS button → change date to 7/17 in settings → check pot.<br/>
3. If you don't like the result, you can go back 1 day and check the secret pot on 7/16.
4. Repeat all the way back to 7/11 if you want.<br/>
5. If you feel like the result on 7/14 was the best, change the date back to 7/14 and register it.
6. If you didn't like any of them, return to 7/11 and take out the item. (If unchanged).

If any of the dates of inserted items go in the negative, all items turn into Weeds,<br/>so it's best to insert items at the same time, rather than inserting across different dates.

If you don't mind more blatant cheating, back up your save data before inserting items.<br/>This lets you retry without having to spend time leveling equipment or reaquiring rare items.<br/>(Requires PS Plus subscription or a PC)

### DS

Simply advance the console time 1 day at a time, checking the secret pot after each change.<br/>
※ If you try to return to a previous date, the item will turn into Weeds.
