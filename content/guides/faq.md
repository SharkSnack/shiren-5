## Before Playing

### Is this a good starting point for the series?

Shiren the Wanderer games have self-contained stories, so you'll be fine regarding the story.<br/>The game also features a Training Facility, which covers gameplay basics.

### How's the difficulty?

The main story of Shiren 5 is on the slightly harder side within this series.<br/>However, if you use Escape Scrolls or Undo Grass and take things slowly, it's not too difficult.

If you've played through earlier games, it may be tricky to adjust to new mechanics or changes, such as:

- New: Night, Equipment growth, Peaches, Super status
- Changes: Identification, Price calculation, Slower HP regeneration as max HP increases
