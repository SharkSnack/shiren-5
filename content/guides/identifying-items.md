# Methods

Identification of items can be generally categorized into 5 main methods.

### Trial

Technique where you just try using the item and determine what it is based on its effect.<br/>
It carries the risk of using a negative item, but it's one of the basic methods of identification.

Every item category except bracelets and pots can be identified, but scrolls and grass items are consumed,<br/>
and you won't know how many uses a staff has left, so it doesn't always guarantee complete identification.

It's best to perform this method right before you advance to the next floor to reduce the impact of negative effects.

### Price

Technique where you narrow down possibilities based on an item's price.<br/>
It doesn't consume the item and there's zero risk, but doesn't guarantee identification.

You can gain insight into all items in your inventory, so players who learn how to do this will have a great advantage,<br/>
especially in dungeons like [Primordial Chasm](/dungeons/primordial-chasm) and [Heavenly Lake](/dungeons/heavenly-lake) where shops always appear on specific floors.

Narrowing down possibilities by price also makes it easier to apply other identification methods to the item.

(See [Price Chart](/items/price-chart) for looking up the price of items)

### Identify Scroll

Reliable method that guarantees complete identification of any item category.<br/>
It's important to make smart use of Identify Scrolls since you generally don't find too many of them.

The ideal way to use an Identify Scroll is to give it to a Shopkeeper to identify all merchandise inside a shop,<br/>
especially in dungeons where shops always appear on specific floors. (The Identify Scroll must be identified)<br/>
If you have enough Gitan to buy items back, go ahead and sell your items before giving the scroll.

If you choose to read the scroll, it's best to use it on item categories that are hard to identify using the Trial method.<br/>
Many pots can be identified by inserting an item, and combined with price identification, you can identify most pots.<br/>
So the cases in which you read the scroll on a pot are limited:

- Synthesis Pot hasn't been identified, and you found a 5 capacity pot and it'll be a while before you see a shop.
- You found a 2 capacity pot which could be a Blessing Pot or Dodger Pot, and want to avoid wasting a use.

On the other hand, there are many bracelets that can't be immediately identified when equipped, and there's<br/>
significant risk in equipping a cursed bracelet, so they're generally the best category for reading an Identify Scroll.

Reading an Identify Scroll occasionally results in a lucky use that identifies all items that aren't inside pots,<br/>
so it's best to take items out of pots and read it only when you have many unidentified items.

### Identify Pot

Multiple items can be identified, but you need to break the pot to retrieve items, and it can't identify pots.<br/>
It's best to insert bracelets, but it's sometimes better to just use it instead of carrying it in hopes of finding bracelets,<br/>
since it takes up an inventory slot that could be held by a different item.

It's fine to insert scrolls and grasses if you've already identified key bracelets like Monsterphobic and Mojo Bracelet.<br/>
It can also be used like an Ordinary Pot to hold items you won't need until later, such as items for Mixer synthesis.

### Mixer Synthesis

Items that are successfully synthesized using Mixers are automatically identified in this game.<br/>
This is fantastic for grass items, since many of them offer more value when synthesized compared to being used.

If one of the items being used in synthesis is already identified, the resulting item will be identified as well.<br/>
This is especially important to remember when synthesizing staves to reveal use counts.

# Bracelets

The most difficult item category to identify.<br/>
Many bracelets can't be immediately identified by being equipped, and you risk equipping a cursed bracelet<br/>
such as Nonary Bracelet or Itemphobic, so never equip a bracelet in situations where you can't unequip it.

Identify Pot and Identify Scroll should be used for bracelets, but you often end up relying on price identification.<br/>
Most bracelets can be identified on the spot if you know the price, excluding 3,000G bracelets.

Bold bracelet names below mean the bracelet can be identified without knowing the price,<br/>
many of which are identified by equipping the bracelet and throwing an item or taking a number of steps.

#### 2,000G

Equip the bracelet and throw an item to determine which bracelet it is.

1. Strength increased = <span class="emphasis">Strength Bracelet</span>
2. Thrown item pierced through walls or creatures = <span class="emphasis">Can. Arm Bracelet</span>
3. Thrown items always miss = <span class="emphasis">Inacc. Bracelet</span>
4. None of the above = Bunch Bracelet

#### 3,000G

Avoid intentionally getting hit by curses, poison, or max value lowering effects to identify bracelets.<br/>
Intentionally step on a trap or get hit by a monster special attack to identify Alert Bracelet and Anti-Cnf. Bracelet.<br/>
If you want to identify the powerful Mojo Bracelet, you can carry a Violent Blade and check for a resonance effect.

1. Resonated with a specific weapon = <span class="emphasis">Anti-Cnf. Bracelet</span> / <span class="emphasis">Alert Bracelet</span> / <span class="emphasis">Mojo Bracelet</span>
2. Fell asleep after taking 10 steps = <span class="emphasis">Dozer Bracelet</span>
3. Received a critical hit from an enemy attack = <span class="emphasis">Critical Bracelet</span>
4. You dealt a critical hit and are carrying a cursed or sealed item = <span class="emphasis">Mojo Bracelet</span>
5. Strength didn't decrease from poison = Cleansing Bracelet
6. Curse was ineffective = Anti-Crs. Bracelet
7. Max HP, max strength, or max fullness didn't decrease = Staunch Bracelet
8. None of the above = Trap Bracelet / Monster Summoner

#### 5,000G

Once you learn that a bracelet is a 5,000G bracelet, you can probably identify it by equipping it.<br/>
If the bracelet is cursed, it's very likely to be Nonary Bracelet or Itemphobic.

1. Enemy positions are displayed = <span class="emphasis">Monster Detector</span> / <span class="emphasis">Monsterphobic</span>
2. Item positions are displayed = <span class="emphasis">Item Detector</span> / <span class="emphasis">Itemphobic</span>
3. Fullness depletes faster = <span class="emphasis">Heal Bracelet</span>
4. Can move through walls = <span class="emphasis">Wall Clip Bracelet</span>
5. Can walk on water = <span class="emphasis">Waterwalk Bracelet</span>
6. Suddenly warped = <span class="emphasis">Blink Bracelet</span>
7. Suddenly exploded = <span class="emphasis">Explosion Bracelet</span>
8. None of the above = Alleyway Bracelet / Nonary Bracelet

#### 10,000G

1. Experience points increased = <span class="emphasis">Growth Bracelet</span>
2. Time of day stopped changing = <span class="emphasis">Time Stop Bracelet</span>
3. Can walk on air tiles = <span class="emphasis">Floating Bracelet</span>
4. None of the above = Anti-Parry Brce.

#### 30,000G

1. Item you picked up was identified = <span class="emphasis">Identify Bracelet</span>
2. Enemy and item positions are displayed = <span class="emphasis">Scout Bracelet</span>
3. Can trap monsters = <span class="emphasis">Trapper Bracelet</span>

#### 50,000G

1. VIP Bracelet

# Staves

Most staves can be identified by swinging them at a monster.<br/>
Price identification can still be used to narrow down possibilities, but it's mostly used to check remaining uses.

Swing the staff from at least 2 tiles away in case it's a Glorious, Swift, or Electric staff,<br/>
and it's best to give it a try when there's only 1 enemy nearby in case it's a Pinning or Swap staff.<br/>
Don't swing staves when your HP < 26 in dungeons where Shocking Staff appears. (Onigiri Hollow, Old Road, etc.)<br/>
The ideal target is a Lv2 monster such as Pit Mamel so that you can identify Unlucky Staff.

Staves that can't be identified right away include Empathy, Balance, Nagging, Ordinary, and Sharing staves.<br/>
Sharing Staff can be identified after swinging by checking Shiren's current state. (Empathetic status)<br/>
Empathy Staff can be identified by taking damage from an enemy attack.<br/>
There's no way to identify Balance, Nagging, or Ordinary staves by swinging them, but Ordinary Staff<br/>
can be identified using Mixer synthesis. However, none of them are really worth taking up inventory space.

If the magic bullet inflicts Slow status, it could either be a Mage or Slow staff,<br/>
so you'll need to swing the staff a few more times to determine which one it is.<br/>
Mage Staff is far more common between the two, so if you find multiple staves, it's likely a Mage Staff.

# Talismans

Identify talismans by throwing them at monsters. They can't be identified by price because they all cost 600G.<br/>
Don't throw talismans at groups of enemies if Enraged, Furious, Swift, and Glorious talismans haven't been identified,<br/>
unless you're standing on the stairs and ready to advance to the next floor.

It's best to throw them at Pit Mamels early game in hopes of one of them being a Glorious Talisman.<br/>
Moseals and Froggos are safe targets to test talismans, as they either don't move or don't attack.

# Scrolls

Reading a scroll identifies all other instances of that scroll, so they're mainly identified by using them.<br/>
It's safest to read them while standing on the stairs right before advancing to the next floor in case it turns out<br/>
to be a dangerous scroll like Muzzled, Grounded, Attraction, Mnster House, etc., but you could also read it<br/>
while standing on an entrance tile of a room if you're hoping for a Mnster House Scrl.

Scrolls that have you select an item should be used on secondary weapons or shields that you don't mind losing.<br/>
You can synthesize the item if it's Plating, Fate, or Earth, but can't reclaim your main equipment if it's Sale or Onigiri.<br/>
Scrolls that cost 200G are always Identify Scroll, so you could save selection-based scrolls until you find a shop.<br/>
Identify Scrolls are pretty common, so you could try using a selection-based scroll on a pot if it's early game too.

Mixer synthesis isn't a reliable method to identify scrolls, since there are very few scrolls that can be synthesized.<br/>
Scrolls eaten by Mixers turn into Wet Scrolls if they couldn't be synthesized, making them unusable until they dry off.<br/>
If you insist on using Mixer identification, only throw scrolls that cost 800G (Desert Scroll) or 3,000G (Lost Scroll).

It's possible to check if a scroll is a selection-based scroll without consuming the item by attempting to read it<br/>
at night without a light source, or while Shiren is afflicted with Blind status.

# Grass

It's best to identify grass items using a combination of price and Mixer synthesis methods instead of using them,<br/>
especially since many grasses offer powerful runes like Anti-Fire, Anti-Floating, Sedating, etc. when synthesized.<br/>
It'll require keeping notes on the side, but you can identify suspicious grasses by throwing them at enemies too,<br/>
such as when you want to check if a 500G grass is Rage Grass without using it yourself.

If you prefer to use them to identify them, it's safest to use grasses while standing on the stairs to the next floor<br/>
without enemies around, since you'll often end up being afflicted by a negative status condition.<br/>
※ You can lose Awakened-ish or Super status when you become afflicted with a negative status condition.

On rare occasions, you might encounter wicked grasses such as Amnesia Grass, Imabikiso, or SuperUnlucky Seed.<br/>
They're mostly found in shops, but remember that night monsters, Maneaters, Snacky, and Munchy drop shop items.

# Pots

There are many types of pots, and a lot of them are useful, so it's important to identify them without being too wasteful.<br/>
"Open" type pots can be identified by using them, and "Insert" type pots can often be identified by price.<br/>
It's not too difficult to figure out what the pot is if you insert an item, even if you don't know the price,<br/>
and the capacity of the pot serves as a hint as well.

You'll want to identify Preservation Pot as quickly as possible early game, so remember that having<br/>
the courage to insert items into pots without waiting to encounter a shop can be beneficial at times.

If you don't know the price of a pot, insert an unidentified item that isn't a talisman. (Talismans can't be blessed/sealed)<br/>
Doing so checks for Preservation, Identify, Black Hole, Curse, Blessing, Perceptive, Zen, Reflection, Dodger, Sale,<br/>
Presto, Floramorph, and Sticky pots.

Synthesis Pot is the most important pot among those that can't be instantly identified by inserting an unidentified item.<br/>
It can be identified by inserting 2 items that can be synthesized together, but there's risk of losing valuable items.<br/>
They always have a capacity of 5, so go ahead and insert extra items into pots that have a capacity of 4 or below,<br/>
and otherwise insert extra weapons, shields, or staves (Mage Staff is good), or wait until you encounter a shop.

The key to not being too wasteful is to limit your attempts to identify pots as you pick them up.<br/>
Important pots include Preservation, Identify, Blessing, Synthesis, Black Hole, Dodger, Reflection, and Zen.<br/>
Once these pots are identified, you can pretty much ignore all other unidentified pots,<br/>
so don't fill your inventory with unidentified pots or waste Identify Scrolls at that point.

#### 600G

They all have a capacity of 3\~5.<br/>
Selecting "Insert" will immediately identify Hide Pot, and insert an unidentified item to identify the others.

1. Shiren gained Hiding status = Hide Pot [3~5]
2. Can take out inserted items = Preservation Pot [3~5]
3. Item was identified = Identify Pot [3~5]
4. Nothing happened = Ordinary Pot [3~5] / 4-2-8 Pot [3~5]

4-2-8 Pots are automatically identified when thrown against a wall, so if a pot is either an Ordinary or 4-2-8 Pot,<br/>
go ahead and assign the name "Ordinary Pot" from the item book name list and throw it against the wall.

Preservation Pot can be identified by attempting to buy an item from a Peddler NPC when your inventory is full.

#### 1,000G

Identified right away by inserting an item other than Gitan, except for pots with a capacity of 3 in shops.<br/>
The inserted item is very likely to be lost, so don't insert anything important.<br/>
A capacity of 2 is always a Black Hole Pot, and is never sold in shops.<br/>
These pots generally aren't too useful, so you don't need to go out of your way to identify them.<br/>
However, you'll want to use an Identify Scroll if you see a pot with a capacity of 3 in shops, since it could be a Fever Pot.

1. Item vanished = Black Hole Pot [2~4]
2. Item turned into Gitan = Sale Pot [3~5]
3. Item turned into a different item = Presto Pot [3~5]
4. Your hand got stuck = Sticky Pot [3~5]
5. Item turned into a flower = Floramorph Pot [3~5]
6. Nothing happened = Unbreakable Pot [3\~5] / Fever Pot [3]

#### 1,600G

They all have a capacity of 2\~4.<br/>
Insert an item that isn't blessed, and that isn't a projectile or talisman.

1. Item doesn't become cursed or sealed = Exorcism Pot [2~4]
2. Item becomes cursed or sealed = Curse Pot [2~4]
3. Item becomes blessed = Blessing Pot [2\~4]

#### 2,500G

They all have a capacity of 2\~4.<br/>
It's a Perceptive, Zen, Dodger, or Reflection pot, so insert an unneeded item to identify it.

#### 3,500G

They're all "Open" type pots, so open it to identify it, but be warned that it could be a Monster Pot.<br/>
Zalokleft Pot is never sold in shops, and an "Open" type pot with a capacity of 2 is always a Hilarious Pot.

#### 6,000G

A pot with a capacity of 3\~4 in this price range is always Modder's Pot.<br/>
If the capacity is 5, it could either be a Synthesis Pot or Modder's Pot, and you won't know until you identify it or throw it.<br/>
Recommended to check the item table of the dungeon you're in to see if Modder's Pot is in the floor or shop item table.

#### 10,000G

These pots are generally exclusive to shops / elite shops, and the only one with practical value is Upgrade Pot.<br/>
Insert an unneeded onigiri that isn't a Grilled Onigiri if capacity is 4\~5.<br/>
Insert an identified and unneeded weapon, shield, or staff is capacity is 2.<br/>
A capacity of 3 could be any of the 5 pots, so insert an onigiri, and then a weapon, shield, or staff if there was no effect.

1. The onigiri transformed into a Grilled Onigiri = Grilling Pot [3~5]
2. Upgrade value or uses increased after changing floors = Upgrade Pot [2~3]
3. Upgrade value or uses decreased after changing floors = Degrade Pot [2~3]
4. Nothing happened after changing floors / inventory item was blessed = Lucky Pot [3~5]
5. Nothing happened after changing floors / inventory item was cursed or sealed = Unlucky Pot [3\~5]
