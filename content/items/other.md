### Gitan

Currency that gets picked up automatically when you walk on top of it.<br/>
Hold B to step on Gitan without picking it up, and either trade it with an item<br/>
or insert it into a Preservation Pot to use the bag of Gitan as an item.

Deals damage equal to 1/10 of the Gitan's value when thrown.<br/>
Deals damage equal to value if blessed, and deals 2 damage if sealed.<br/>
This is the same if you get hit by Gitan due to a Kappa Troll or Kleptoad.<br/>
Froggo family monsters will restore HP if they get hit by Gitan.

Gitan thrown by Kojirouta has piercing properties, and is never blessed or sealed.<br/>
Froggos, Gitan Mamel (2000G), and Ultra Gazer (5000G) always drop Gitan.

The Point Shop can reissue it without a loss of points for 1000 Gitan.<br/>
If you end the game without saving or set the system time backward,<br/>
your point balance will be set to 0. (even if you weren't carrying the card)

### Dirt

Dirt inside a pot, caused by Scoopie family monster special attacks.<br/>
Generally, pots that have been filled with dirt are unusable.<br/>
Dirt has a chance to transform into a grass item when you change floors.<br/>
Grass items generated from Dirt will never be blessed or sealed.<br/>
If the capacity of a pot filled with Dirt is increased using a Pot God Scroll,<br/>
the added slot will automatically fill with Dirt.

Scoopies throwing dirt into pots:

- Preservation
    - Pot fills with dirt, can't remove items until the dirt changes to grass.
- Ordinary, Synthesis, Sale, Presto, Identify, Exorcism, Blessing, Curse, Sticky,<br/>Unbreakable, Upgrade, Degrade, Lucky, Unlucky, 4-2-8, Modder's, Floramorph, Grilling
    - Pot fills with dirt.
- Hide, Heal, Hilarious, Zalokleft, Klein, Monster, Water, Shrine Maid., Heavenly
    - Dirt can't go inside the pot.
- Black Hole
    - Capacity is reduced to 0.
- Fever
    - If empty, the pot shatters. If there was an item inside, the pot explodes.
- Zen, Dodger, Perceptive, Reflection
    - Capacity is reduced to 0, and the fragrance effect activates.

</table>

### Flowers

Items that can only exist inside of a Floramorph Pot.<br/>
The flowers will vanish if you use an Extraction Scroll or break the pot.

The What you need is...? problem in Statue Cave has a Floramorph Pot<br/>
which can be used to quickly fill out the flower entries in the Item Book.

<table class="itemDetailsTable">
  <tr>
    <th>Rue</th>
    <td>This small yellow flower looks adorable.<br/>You also feel like it's giving off an<br/>ominous aura, but I'm sure that's just<br/>your imagination. Pay no attention to it.</td>

    <th>Rose</th>
    <td>They say that every rose has its thorn,<br/>just like every cowboy has a sad, sad<br/>song. Thorns on weeds are just annoying,<br/>but somehow a rose's thorns are seen as<br/>part of the flower's charm. It is almost<br/>as if the flowers themselves cast some<br/>kind of magic.</td>
    <td><img src="../images/flowers/rose.jpg" alt="rose"></img></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Plum Tree</th>
    <td>In springtime, white or pink flowers<br/>bloom on this plant. They're not as<br/>elegant as cherry blossoms, but the plum<br/>tree still has its own distinct, stately<br/>grace.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Rafflesia</th>
    <td>It stinks. It stinks SO bad. It does this<br/>to attract flies that will carry its<br/>pollen. Why did it have to be like that?<br/>Was having bees and butterflies collect<br/>pollen too mainstream for it? This is yet<br/>another mystery of the natural world.</td>

    <th>Sunflower</th>
    <td>A large, round, bright yellow flower<br/>that turns itself to face the sun.<br/>If the seeds bear fruit, you can<br/>attract a Cheer-Ham and get it<br/>to ally with you.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Red Spider<br/>Lily</th>
    <td>On top of its thin stalk is a bright red<br/>flower with thin petals that spread<br/>outward. The flower looks graceful on its<br/>own, but they're a breathtaking sight<br/>when they grow in clusters. Some say that<br/>the flower is a bad omen. Could it be<br/>poisonous?</td>

    <th>Gentian</th>
    <td>When you're traveling o'er hills and<br/>dales, you can look down and see these<br/>purple flowers. You feel compelled to<br/>make the dungeon a calming place<br/>befitting of these flowers. Part of the<br/>series of <span class="red_text_2">Floramorph Pot</span>.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Queen of<br/>the Night</th>
    <td>This large white flower blooms at night<br/>and wilts by the morning. A transient<br/>beauty of the evening, if you will.<br/>While it's inside the pot it stays<br/>blossoming. This pot's wonderful, but it<br/>kills some of the romance of these<br/>things.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Agave</th>
    <td>This plant is famous for the liquor that<br/>that is made from nectar extracted from<br/>its core. It was taken to <span class="orange_text">Cahitan Island</span><br/>from <span class="orange_text">Texas</span> and is being grown as a<br/>new kind of experimental crop.</td>

### Friendship License

※ This item does not get registered to the Item Book

Item that serves as a replacement for monster meat found in previous games.<br/>
Friendship Licenses are sold as individual monster licenses (example: Mamel Lic.),<br/>
and can be purchased at the License Shop in Nekomaneki Village.<br/>
They can also be obtained by defeating Dueling status monsters,<br/>
or by reading a Nixer Scroll when a monster is adjacent to you.

If the license is in your inventory and not inside a pot, the matching monster family will<br/>
become your ally. (example: Mamel Lic. = Mamel, Pit Mamel, Cave Mamel, Gitan Mamel)<br/>
Hostile monsters won't attack ally monsters, and ally monsters who defeat enemies<br/>
won't level up or grant experience points to Shiren.

If Shiren attacks an ally monster, all licenses in your inventory for that monster vanish,<br/>
including licenses inside pots. Licenses inside pots or with sealed status are ineffective.<br/>
If you only have a sealed license, attacking a matching monster won't make it vanish.

Licenses can turn into a Blank Scroll when you exit a floor where the matching monster appears.<br/>
This also applies to licenses inside pots, and occurs roughly around 10\~20% of the time.<br/>
Maneater licenses only turn into a Blank Scroll when you exit a floor where they spawned.<br/>
Night monsters won't become your ally, and attacking a matching night monster<br/>
won't make licenses vanish.

<table class="itemDetailsTable">
  <tr>
    <th>Item<br/>Book</th>
    <td>If you hold a monster's license, that<br/>particular type of monster will become<br/>your ally in the dungeon. Attacking an<br/>allied monster will destroy the license.<br/>If you exit the floor where that monster<br/>appears, the license may change into a<br/>different item.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### N'dubba

N'dubba, N'twyn, N'mach, or N'dup disguised as an item.<br/>
The monster reveals itself if you try to use the item or throw it at an enemy.<br/>
It'll fail to reveal itself if you're currently in Thief Mode, and will vanish instead.<br/>
It's somewhat common to see an N'mach when you return from a deep dungeon.

<table class="itemDetailsTable">
  <tr>
    <th>N'mach</th>
    <td>This item is not what it appears!<br/>It's an unscrupulous monster mimicking<br/>an item! It hasn't noticed that its<br/>chicanery has been uncovered.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Unknown

※ This item does not get registered to the Item Book

Exists in select pots, and shows its effect when the pot is opened or an Extraction Scroll is used.<br/>
List includes Heal, Zalokleft, Monster, Shrine Maid., Klein, and Hilarious pots.

<table class="itemDetailsTable">
  <tr>
    <th>Item<br/>Book</th>
    <td>Unknown contents. Open it to figure<br/>out what it is.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Water

※ This item does not get registered to the Item Book

Exists inside a filled Water Pot, and can be splashed 1 tile ahead for various effects.<br/>
See the Water Pot section on the Pots page for usage details.

<table class="itemDetailsTable">
  <tr>
    <th>Item<br/>Book</th>
    <td>When wet, fire monsters will take damage,<br/>machines will malfunction, and blades will<br/>rust. There are lots of effects to it.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Hot Spring Water

※ This item does not get registered to the Item Book

Exists inside a Heavenly Pot, which can be filled at the hot spring in Inori Village.<br/>
Use it to fully restore Shiren's HP and cure most status conditions.<br/>
Can also be splashed like a Water Pot to heal other creatures.<br/>
Unlike Water Pots, scrolls won't get wet, and equipment won't rust.

Heavenly Pots can only be used in dungeons that allow carry-in items,<br/>
which limits its usage to main story dungeons, Inori Cave, and Lost Well.<br/>
Plus it can only be used 3 times, so it likely won't last until the end of 99F dungeons.<br/>
Further, it's so rare that you don't want to discard it after using it, and carrying it<br/>
comes with the risk of it shattering from a Trip Trap.

You can heal allies using items like Immunity Scroll and Heal Grass,<br/>
so really, it's probably best to just keep the pot inside your storage.

<table class="itemDetailsTable">
  <tr>
    <th>Item<br/>Book</th>
    <td>When Shiren and allies are splashed<br/>with it, it will restore most of their HP<br/>and cure status ailments.<br/>A slight sulfuric smell wafts upward<br/>from the steam that rises from the<br/>milky water. If only you could use this<br/>water with Hide Pot.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
