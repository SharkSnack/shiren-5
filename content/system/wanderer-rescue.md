# Overview

Wanderer Rescue is a system where you can request help from other players up to 3 times if you collapse.<br/>
Rescue requests are made using the game's servers, or as a password you input manually.

For story dungeons, the rescuer simply has to send a Revival Grass or Undo Grass from Nekomaneki Village.<br/>
Other dungeons require the rescuer to enter and locate the collapsed player inside a dungeon.<br/>
(The dungeon will have the same seed, meaning items, map layout, enemies, etc. will be identical)

Once the collapsed player receives a revival spell, they can continue their adventure without item loss.<br/>
The rescuer will be rewarded with an item, rescue points, and can receive a thank you letter from the other player.

Switch / Steam versions have cross-platform rescues, and aren't region-locked.<br/>
※ Switch / Steam passwords are not compatible with the PS Vita version.

# Requesting

### Requirements (Request)


- Rescues must be allowed in the dungeon's rules.<br/>Not Allowed: Hunter Pond, Rousing Paradise, Aura Ruins, Storm Forest,<br/>Perilous Rocks, Trapper's Sandbox, The Pinnacle, Cloister of Certain Doom.

- There must be remaining rescues.<br/>You can be rescued up to 3 times - once you've used those up, you'll fail the adventure.

- Thief Mode must not be active.<br/>You can't request a rescue if you collapse while in Thief Mode.<br/>If a Shopkeeper became hostile without triggering Thief Mode, you can still be rescued.

- You must not be waiting for a rescue / currently attempting a rescue.<br/>Requests can't be sent if you collapse while waiting for a rescue, or if you collapse while attempting a rescue.

### Method 1 - Internet

Send a rescue request to the game's server.<br/>
A 12 digit rescue number is displayed once sent, which you can share with others.<br/>
※ The rescue ID will be deleted from the server once fulfilled.

<span class="orangeText">There isn't a "Rescue (Eng), Enter rescue #." option when searching for rescues,<br/>so always select "Category (Anyone)" when sending requests via Internet connection.</span>

### Method 2 - Password

Share a rescue request in the form of a 54 character password.<br/>
Less convenient, but the password never expires and works offline.

Often used to share dungeon seeds that have rare items, since it doesn't expire after a successful rescue.<br/>
(See [Rescue Passwords](/guides/rescue-passwords))

### Wanderer Awaiting Rescue

Go on adventures while waiting to be rescued. (Waiting for rescue → Wanderer awaiting rescue)

This can be an excellent way to obtain rare items, especially in PS Vita / Switch / Steam dungeons.<br/>
Sell items between runs by talking to the storehouse manager and selecting organize.

- You can only enter dungeons you've been to before, and only as deep as your personal best depth.
- You can't request a rescue if you collapse.
- Clearing a dungeon won't count toward the leaderboards or adventure footprints.
    - Dungeon Center dungeons will still receive a checkmark, if applicable.

# Rescuing

### Requirements (Rescue)

- The rescue must be in a dungeon you've been to before.<br/>The target floor must be less than or equal to your personal best depth.

- You must not be waiting for a rescue.<br/>Rescues can't be attempted while you're waiting to be rescued.

### Rescue Tips

- The dungeon will have the same seed, meaning items, map layout, enemies, etc. will be identical.
    - This provides a significant advantage if the person who requested shares their notes.
- The target floor is freshly generated, and the collapsed target is always in a Monster House.
- If time of day changes after the Monster House is cleared, new monsters will surround the target.
- It's possible to rescue yourself using a different save file.
- Transient Staff sends the target next to the collapsed target.
- The floor is cleared of enemies when the person who requested receives the revival spell and continues.
    - However, if there's a hostile shopkeeper, they'll still be present.
    - Wandering NPCs like Madam Ateska can change the dungeon RNG.
