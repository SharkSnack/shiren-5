metaDescription: "List of Status Conditions for Shiren the Wanderer 2: Oni Invasion!"
---

## Overview

Shiren and monsters can be inflicted by effects called status conditions.<br/>
Conditions with negative effects are called ailments, and restrict the character's actions.<br/>
Ailments can have a drastic impact toward combat or even your adventure as a whole.<br/>
It's good to have some basic knowledge for each one so that they can be utilized for benefit.<br/>
Since there are few conditions with positive effects, they're grouped with ailments.

These effects fit into 2 categories - status conditions (ailments), and Shiren-exclusive effects.<br/>
Status conditions and Shiren-exclusive effects both include negative and positive effects.<br/>
This page also includes information on how status conditions affect monsters.

## Basics

Most effects only last for a set number of turns, and are cured after the duration expires.<br/>
Status conditions that last for the duration of the current floor only apply to monsters.

Movement speed cannot be both slowed and hastened at the same time.<br/>
Think of it as the character's action speed stage increasing or decreasing by 1.<br/>
There is one exception, however, where a Talk Seed effect can slow a character down to<br/>1 action every 2 turns even if they were moving at double or triple speed.

Paralysis is unrelated to action speed, and can occur even when a character is hastened.<br/>If a Slow Staff is swung at a character that is already slowed, they become paralyzed<br/>and their action speed stage will reset.

Drinking Good Water or Perfect Water cures all status conditions except hastened speed,<br/>
and being revived by Revival Grass cures all status conditions.

## Status List

For rows with 2 descriptions, the above one is for Shiren, and the one below is for monsters.<br/>
Causes that have a monster name represent a special attack used by that monster.

Duration (turns) begins when Shiren first takes action after the character gains the condition.<br/>
For example, if a Devil Kangaroo swings its Invisible Staff at a monster, in either case<br/>
of the monster becoming invisible after acting or before acting, the invisibility ends<br/>after Shiren performs 20 turns worth of actions. So the monster would be invisible for<br/>20 turns in the first case, or 21 turns in the second case.

## Shiren Exclusive

Some special conditions are exclusive to Shiren.<br/>
Of these effects, ones that are caused by items can be particularly beneficial.

Whereas status conditions include many negative effects, most Shiren-exclusive effects<br/>are positive, and none of them wear off based on the number of elapsed turns.

"Floor" in the Turns column means the effect lasts the entire time spent on the current floor.
