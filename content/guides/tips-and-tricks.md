# Readiness

#### Expect the Worst

The mantra of a roguelike is "Hope for the best, expect the worst".<br/>
Generally, the more you plan for bad situations, the further you'll be able to progress.

- Don't move without purpose near enemies
    - Draw enemies closer by stepping in place so that you get the first hit.
    - If there's a group of enemies, retreat into a hallway and fight 1-on-1.
    - Check the identity of distant enemies in the room using the Scout command.
    - Dashing is dangerous. Always walk when there are strong enemies around, or when it's night.
- Act before your situation gets bad
    - Have an idea how much damage each enemy deals.
    - It can sometimes be too late even if you use an item after your situation becomes dire.
        - Don't be stingy with items. Collapsing when you still had powerful items is the worst.
    - HP regeneration slows as max HP increases, making it harder to heal by moving around.
        - Use items to avoid receiving damage in the first place to conserve healing items.
- What if this direct attack misses?
    - Direct attack accuracy is 92%, so the chance to land 2 in a row is ~85%.
        - Direct attack accuracy increases up to 95% depending on weapon level.
    - If you and an enemy are both 1 hit away from collapsing, don't gamble on a direct attack.
    - Don't mash the attack button without checking how much damage you're taking.
- What if this projectile misses?
    - Projectile accuracy is 84%, so the chance to land 3 in a row is less than 60%.
    - Position a monster on top of a trap to cover for missed throws.
    - If a strong monster is adjacent, use a staff or scroll instead of a projectile.
- Run from an enemy, and then what?
    - What will you do if you become sandwiched by enemies in a hallway if you run?
    - The player entering or leaving a room can cause napping monsters to wake up.
- Even stronger enemies might appear
    - Have I leveled up enough?
    - Should I break a pot so that I have more usable items on hand?
    - Do I understand what each of the items in my inventory do?
    - Have I identified all staves and talismans before advancing?
- I might not find any more food
    - Is it really fine to discard Rotten Onigiri and grass? (Grass items replenish 5 fullness)
- There may be hidden traps nearby
    - Use direct attacks to check for Pit Trap, Explosion Trap, etc. when moving toward items.
- Monster House Encounter
    - Use the Scout command before taking any actions and note escape routes.
    - Check your items to see if you have something that lets you overcome the situation.
    - There are lots of traps in a Monster House, so moving on ground tiles is dangerous.
- Categorize inventory items
    - If you're struggling to choose what to discard, think of items as categories.
    - "Food", "Restore HP", "For Monster House", "Emergency Escape", "1-vs-1", etc.
- Don't be in a rush
    - This isn't an action game, so there's no need for fast inputs.
        - You're likely to attack in the wrong direction or throw a Preservation Pot if you hurry.
    - If you're feeling annoyed for being put into a seemingly unfair situation, set the controller down.
        - Your thinking performance drops when you're irritated, so take a moment to gather yourself.

There's really an endless list of thoughts or worries that can cross your mind, so it's similar to driving,<br/>
where you prepare for and are ready to react to situations. (Example: a squirrel running across the road).<br/>
It's important to be aware of what has the potential to occur at any given time, and act accordingly.

That said, you don't want to overdo the thinking to the point of getting stuck in decision paralysis.<br/>
Overthinking can lead to mistakes as well, so don't stress or worry too much, and enjoy the gameplay.

The key to the main story is to recognize when you're reaching your limit, and escape as needed to regroup.<br/>
No one will give you a hard time for escaping, even if it's on an early floor.

#### Common Missed Inputs

- Inserted main equipment into a Presto Pot
    - Often occurs when you're tired, or nervous in late game floors.
    - Remember that the cursor moves to the top when you press right while viewing the item you're standing on.
    - Perhaps it's best to make a habit of selecting the item with R before inserting.
- Stepped on a trap that you revealed using a direct attack.
    - Occurs when you get into the habit of "Direct attack → take a step".
    - Slow down your inputs, or make an effort to pause after using a direct attack.
    - Reframe checking for traps as "Take a step → direct attack".
- Threw an item at a Shopkeeper while identifying
    - Often occurs when you're naming items while checking a price chart, and usually results in a failed adventure.
    - Place items away from the Shopkeeper, or make a habit to face away before opening your inventory.
- (DS version) Pressed B + L to Scout, but shot an arrow instead
    - Make a habit to press B before L. (Pressing B alone doesn't end your turn)
    - However, that will make you dash instead of scout if you miss the L input.
    - Perhaps it's best to always select the Scout option from the menu, instead of using shortcuts.
    - ※ Use the right analog stick to scout on PS Vita, Switch, and Steam versions.

# Food

#### Replenishing Fullness

It might seem like eating food you find on the ground or buy from shops is the only way to replenish fullness,<br/>but there are actually a number of other ways to either replenish fullness or obtain edible items.

<div class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/other/onigiri.png"/>
</div>

Food items:

|Item|Fullness|
|-|-|
|Rotten Onigiri|30|
|Special Onigiri|30|
|Dog Onigiri|50|
|Onigiri|50|
|Grilled Onigiri|60|
|Large Onigiri|100|
|Huge Onigiri|Max|
|Rotten Peach|15|
|Hard Peach|30|
|Peach|50|
|Juicy Peach|100|
|Squid Sushi Scroll|40|
|Any grass item|5|

Other sources:

|Source|Fullness|
|-|-|
|Read Fixer Scroll while starving|Max|
|Revive via Revival or Undo grass, Wanderer Rescue|Max|
|Get hit by Mutaikon family special attacks|5|
|Get hit by Grass Kid family special attacks|5|
|Get hit by a peach or grass thrown by Bored Kappa|Varies|
|Bowl Shield (<span class="greenText">Pain Fueled</span>) - 6% chance|1|
|Stay at an Inn (Hermit's Hermitage, Sparrow's Inn)|Max|

Methods to obtain food / increase quality:

|Method|Item|
|-|-|
|Find food on the ground|Varies|
|Buy food from shops|Varies|
|Obtain food from Presto Pot|Varies|
|Read an Onigiri Scroll|Large Onigiri|
|Read a Commend. Letter|Large Onigiri|
|Get hit by fire or explosion damage<br/>(Rotten, Special, Dog, Onigiri)|Grilled Onigiri|
|Throw onigiri at Kid Squid monsters<br/>(Rotten, Special)|Squid Sushi Scroll|
|Trigger Decay Trap on a monster|Rotten Onigiri|
|Splash water on Onigiri status monster|Rotten Onigiri|
|Splash water on a peach to ripen it<br/>(Hard Peach, Peach)|Varies|
|Advance floors to ripen peaches|Varies|
|Defeat Kumonigiri or Nigiri Morph|Onigiri|
|Defeat Nigiri Boss|Large Onigiri|
|Defeat Nigiri King|Huge Onigiri|
|Defeat Foul Nigiri Morph, Boss, or King|Rotten Onigiri|
|Defeat Zalokleft family monsters|Varies|
|Get hit by Nigiri Morph's special attack|Large Onigiri|
|Get hit by Foul Nigiri Morph's sp.attack|Rotten Onigiri|
|Place items in a room with Field Knave|Weeds|
|Talk to Tao when you're starving|Onigiri|

#### Protect Food from Decay Traps

Decay Trap only affects onigiri and peaches that are not inside pots,<br/>
so simply keep onigiri and peaches inside pots to keep them safe.

<div class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/traps/decay.png"/>
</div>

#### Eating Priority

If you don't have a pot to store food in, it's best to eat food that restores a lot of fullness first<br/>to reduce the loss from stepping on a Decay Trap.

If you have a pot to store food in, or there's no risk of stepping on a Decay Trap,<br/>
it's best to eat food that restores the least amount of fullness first to free up inventory space.

#### Grilling Onigiri

<div class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/traps/explosion.png"/> <img src="../images/monsters/pop_tank.png"/>
</div>

Get hit by fire or explosion damage to turn all onigiri that aren't in pots into Grilled Onigiri (60 fullness, 40 HP).<br/>Seals and blessings are removed when onigiri are grilled, so it can be used to unseal onigiri items.<br/>Rotten Onigiri (30 → 60) and Onigiri (50 → 60) are the two best types of onigiri to grill.

Zen Pot can be used to grill onigiri without receiving damage from fire or explosions,<br/>
but the <span class="greenText">Anti-Blast※</span> rune will make you unable to grill onigiri using explosions.

#### Making Squid Sushi Scroll

<div class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/monsters/kid_squid.png"/>
</div>

Kid Squid monsters turn into Squid Sushi Scroll when they get hit by an onigiri item,<br/>granting experience points and a food item that replenishes 40 fullness.<br/>Keep that in mind if you have Rotten Onigiri on hand.

#### Ripening Peaches

<div class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/other/peach.png"/>
</div>

Changing floors ripens peaches outside of pots. (Hard Peach → Peach → Juicy Peach → Rotten Peach)<br/>
It takes 3 floors to ripen a Hard Peach into a Peach, and 2 floors for the others.

Water also ripens a peach by 1 stage, and floor count isn't reset when a peach ripens due to water.<br/>
(Example: Peach will become a Juicy Peach next floor, ripen it using water, it'll become a Rotten Peach next floor)<br/>
Water sources include Water Pots, walking on water using a Waterwalk Bracelet, and tsunamis in the DS version.<br/>
Decay Trap will always transform a peach into a Rotten Peach.

<p><span class="purpleText">Juicy Peach</span> restores the most fullness and refreshes 8 abilities, but <span class="purpleText">Peach</span> cures ailments and restores strength,<br/>
and also grants the powerful Immune status when blessed, so remember that when managing ripeness using pots.<br/>
<span class="purpleText">Rotten Peach</span> can be thrown at an enemy to lower their attack and defense.</p>

# Dungeon

#### Early Game Combat

In this game, HP regenerates faster when your max HP is low.<br/>Get in the habit of retreating a few steps to recover HP while fighting near the start of an adventure.<br/>Watch out for Seedie's high attack power in particular when you don't have a shield.

#### Step in Place

HP only regenerates when you either move or step in place - not when you attack.<br/>So hold B and tap A to pass 1 turn when waiting for a monster to approach, rather than attacking to pass the turn.<br/>However, if your HP is full, performing an attack is better since it checks if the tile in front has a hidden trap.<br/>These are tiny optimizations, but can make a difference over the course of an adventure.

#### Heal Before Advancing

Step in place (B + A) while standing on the stairs to recover HP before advancing to the next floor.<br/>You don't know what type of situation you'll start in, so healing when you can is important.<br/>If a monster enters the stairs room, go ahead and advance.
