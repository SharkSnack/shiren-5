### Shop

#### Regular

Shops are rooms containing a single shopkeeper and merchandise for sale.<br/>
The ground is covered in carpet, and there are no traps inside the room.<br/>
It's possible to create Pit Traps by breaking a Black Hole Pot.<br/>Zalokleft Pot is nullified while standing on a carpeted tile.

<div class="relativeImage smallScreenshot">
  <img src="../images/other/dungeon_shop.jpg"/>
</div>

The shopkeeper will offer to place a tag or identify merchandise if you talk to him<br/>when you haven't picked up any merchandise.

- Place a Tag
    - Costs 2000 Gitan.
    - Nice way to take home rare items in dungeons that don't allow carry-in items.
- Identify Merchandise
    - Give him an identified Identify Scroll and he'll identify all items with a price tag.
    - Items inside pots are also identified, as long as they have a price tag.
    - The disguise of N'twyn, N'mach, and N'dup will be canceled if present.

Disguised N'dubba monsters can be sold to the shopkeeper.<br/>
However, if you then cancel their disguise, the shopkeeper will ask for payment.

Like Shiren 4, Shopkeepers won't attack monsters even if they're hit by them.<br/>
Shopkeepers warp to you if you're about to leave the shop while carrying merchandise,<br/>but won't warp if you're standing diagonal to the entrance.<br/>He'll ask for payment every turn in this position.

The color of carpet varies based on the current floor's wall and ground tile set.

#### Elite

Shop hidden inside a wall and guarded by a shopkeeper at the end of a hallway.<br/>
Either a Recommend. Letter or VIP Bracelet is needed to be granted entry.<br/>
There are 6 items for sale, which are usually much higher in quality.<br/>
Like regular shops, the shopkeeper can place a tag or identify merchandise.

<div class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/other/elite_shop_1.png"/> <img src="../images/other/elite_shop_2.png"/>
</div>

Recommend. Letter is a scroll, so it can be written on a Blank Scroll after you've read it once.<br/>The Recommend. Letter is consumed when it's shown to the shopkeeper,<br/>but the letter can be used again if it was blessed. (Blessing wears off)<br/>
Showing a Commend. Letter forces you to purchase a Large Onigiri for all of your Gitan.

The shop can be revealed by punching the wall, and doing so won't trigger Thief Mode.<br/>However, if you step inside the shop without being granted entry, Thief Mode will be triggered.<br/>Unlike regular shops, an elite shop won't join together with other rooms if you expand it.

#### Pick-A-Choice

Shop featuring a mini-game where you either obtain a rare item or fall into a Pit Trap.

- Costs 1000 Gitan per play.
- Wins and losses are recorded in Adventure Footprints.
- If you win, you can challenge it again on the same floor.
    - Rare item and Pit Trap placements can change sides from the previous play.
- It's possible to cheat by reading a Collection Scroll.
    - Obtaining the item this way doesn't count as a win for Adventure Footprints.
- Reading a Coupon Scroll lets you play for free 1 time.

<br/>

<div id="pickachoiceImage" class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/other/pick_a_choice.png"/>
</div>

Other notes:

- Entrance layout is selected from 3 patterns.
- The walls of the shop can't be destroyed.
- It's possible to switch positions with the shopkeeper.
- The launch pads and Pit Traps inside the shop always activate.
    - Even if you have a Floating Bracelet or Trapper Bracelet equipped.
- End points are hidden each time you play.
- The rock throwing trick from Shiren 4 doesn't work in this game.

#### Merchandise

- Price tag is removed if a Mixer eats the item, or if the item is thrown outside the shop.
    - This means merchandise can be synthesized.
    - The shopkeeper will require payment for said item.
- Won't transform into a different item if inserted into a Presto Pot.
    - Sale Pot, Sale Scroll, and Onigiri Scroll are effective.
- Won't be synthesized if inserted into a Synthesis Pot.
    - The item gets synthesized if you pay for the item and insert another item.
- Cannot write on Blank Scrolls that have a price tag.
    - This is to prevent getting items for free by writing Coupon Scroll.
- Price tags are removed from all items on the current floor when a Coupon Scroll is read.
    - You can then read a Collection Scroll to gather shop items, including elite shops.

#### Item Table

The item table for dungeons is split into the following categories:

- Floor items, day monster drops
- Regular shops, night monster drops, Maneater drops, shiny object (yellow)
- Elite shops, Pick-A-Choice shops, shiny object (blue)
- Presto Pot
- Zalokleft drops
- Mealy drops, rescue reward

#### Shopkeeper

Shopkeepers turn hostile if you deal damage, hit them with an item or magic bullet, etc.<br/>The dot representing the shopkeeper on the map changes from yellow to red.<br/>You cannot talk to a hostile shopkeeper, so you have to either fight or run.

Their anger subsides once they've defeated you, unless Thief Mode is active.<br/>(So if you revive using Revival Grass, you can talk to them again)


They have special dialogue if you talk while they're wandering around outside their shop.

#### Thief Mode

Occurs when you exit a shop without paying for merchandise, or if you enter an elite shop<br/>without showing a Recommend. Letter or VIP Bracelet.

- All enemies on the current floor change to shopkeepers.
- New shopkeepers are immediately generated until the 20 character limit is reached.
- Enemy spawn cycle speeds up. (1 shopkeeper every 5 turns)
- Monsters that were on water, air, or wall tiles will warp to a room.
- Monster house turns into an enforcer house. (Special monster house)

Hostile Shopkeepers:

- Status conditions are effective, including abilities like Pot Party.
    - However, they're immune to Three Screams and Transmogrification.
- Ignore Sanctuary Scrolls.
- Receive damage from thrown Gitan like normal. (Unlike Maneaters)
- Don't change color when they level up.

Changes to Actions:

- Cannot return to Nekomaneki Village via Escape Scroll or Undo Grass.
- Cannot request a rescue if you collapse.
- Cannot talk to allies or wandering NPCs.
- Equipment tags are nullified.
- Floor warp effect of Gambler's Scroll is still effective.

### Monster House

Monster houses are rooms packed with monsters, items, and hidden traps.

<div class="relativeImage screenshot">
  <img src="../images/other/monster_house.jpg"/>
</div>

#### Characteristics

There are 2 categories of monster houses:

- Regular: Contains monsters chosen from the current floor's monster table.
- Special: Contains specific families even if they're not in the current floor's monster table.

Encounter types:

- Initial: Monster house is present and visible from the start of the floor.
- Sudden: Monster house suddenly appears while walking inside a room.
- Re-entry: Monster house appears when you re-enter a room.

The music changes, and an announcement is displayed in the scrolling messages window.<br/>The music differs between regular and special monster houses, and returns to normal<br/>once there are no monsters left in the room.

Mnster House Scrl can be read to generate a monster house, but enemies will get 1 action<br/>after being generated before you can act unless you ate Swift Grass beforehand.<br/>
If the scroll is read in a hallway or shop, you'll warp to a random room first.<br/>
If there's already a monster house, the next floor turns into a single room monster house.

#### Encounter Types

<p><span class="highlightPurple">Initial:</span> Monster house is present and visible from the start of the floor.</p>

- Items like Monster Detector can be used to detect the monster house beforehand.
- Easy to tell if there are lots of monsters and items near a room's entrance.
- All enemies in the room have Napping status, and wake up when you enter the room.
    - Includes Absorbiphant and Naptapir monsters.
- Thin out monsters before entering using arrows, talismans, Can. Arm Bracelet, etc.

<p><span class="highlightPurple">Sudden:</span> Monster house suddenly appears while walking inside a room.</p>

- Cannot be avoided by checking for traps or eating Perception Grass.
- The exact trigger condition is unknown.
    - Possibly completely random, or caused by stepping on a specific tile.
- Can trigger at the same time as stepping on a trap.
- The most dangerous type, since you can get caught in the middle of a room.
- Use items like Pinning Staff, Warp Grass, or Confusion Scroll to overcome it.

<p><span class="highlightPurple">Re-entry:</span> Monster house appears when you re-enter a room.</p>

- Often catches players off guard since they've already been inside the room.
- Dangerous if you're running from an enemy in a hallway.
    - High level Gyazas in particular can end a run unless you have Warp Grass.
- If you're not in a rush, go ahead and re-enter rooms to check for these.

- Invincible Grass
    - Receive 0 damage for 20 turns.

    - Swift enemies recover quickly, and Gyaza and Absorbiphants are immune.

### Traps

List of traps and their effects.<br/>
→ <a href="/system/traps">Traps</a>

<div class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/traps/wood_arrow.png"/> <img src="../images/traps/sleep.png"/> <img src="../images/traps/gauge_blind.png"/>
</div>

### Wind of Kron

If you linger on a floor too long, wind will blow you away.<br/>
The first 3 gusts are warnings, and the 4th forces you back to Nekomaneki Village.<br/>
Revival Grass and Undo Grass don't take effect, and you lose all items and Gitan.

<div class="relativeImage smallScreenshot">
  <img src="../images/other/wind.jpg"/>
</div>

The number of turns until wind begins to blow varies by dungeon.<br/>
It's best to hurry to the exit when a warning is displayed, and use an Escape Scroll<br/>or Undo Grass if you don't think you can make it in time.

Warning Messages:

1. You feel the wind picking up.
2. The wind blows harder.
3. The wind gusts vigorously!

### Hidden Room

Room buried inside a wall, which can be revealed by attacking the room's edge.<br/>
It can also be revealed by equipping an Alleyway Bracelet and approaching the entrance,<br/>or by equipping a Wall Clip Bracelet and stepping into the buried room.

<div id="hiddenRoom" class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/other/buried_room.gif"/>
</div>

The stairs are never located inside hidden rooms.<br/>
Lost Well can rarely feature floors where most hallways and rooms are hidden.<br/>
People online aren't joking when they say punch walls on floors where there's no path forward.

### Hidden Hallway

Hallway buried inside a wall, which can be revealed by attacking the entrance.<br/>
It can also be revealed by equipping an Alleyway Bracelet and approaching the entrance,<br/>or by equipping a Wall Clip Bracelet and stepping into the buried hallway.<br/>
Shiren will stop next to a hidden hallway's entrance if you dash along the wall.

### Shiny Object

Tile where either an item or monster is buried in the ground.<br/>
Only 1 shiny object can be generated on a floor.

If it's an item, it's randomly selected from the shop / night monster drop table.<br/>
They're not visible on the map, so use the Scout command to search for them.

<div class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/other/shiny_object_yellow.gif"/>
</div>

There's a rare variant that requires at least 9 strength to dig up.<br/>In this case, the item is randomly selected from the elite shop table.

<div class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/other/shiny_object_blue.gif"/>
</div>

### Item Island

Ground surrounded by a waterway with 3 items and a Spring Trap.

<div id="islandImage" class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/other/island.png"/>
</div>

How to Obtain Items:

- Use a Zalokleft Pot.
- Read a Desert Scroll.
- Swing a Swap Staff or Pinning Staff at a Floating type monster.
- Equip a Waterwalk Bracelet and walk across the water tiles.

### Gitan Room

Room surrounded by wall tiles, containing 15 bags of Gitan and 1 Spring Trap.<br/>
One Napping enemy is always generated inside the room at the start of the floor.

<div class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/other/gitan_room.png"/>
</div>

Can be detected using Monster Detector, Item Detector, Navigation Scroll, etc.<br/>
Items like Rusty Pickaxe, Boring Staff, or Warp Grass are needed to enter.<br/>
Rarely connected to a waterway, letting you enter using a Waterwalk Bracelet.<br/>
Wandering NPCs can occasionally be generated inside the room.

### Buried Items

Items generated inside walls at the start of the floor.<br/>Only appears in a few dungeons like Onigiri Hollow and Lost Well.<br/>Items seem to have a unique item table, and while projectiles or Gitan are common,<br/>it can occasionally be a higher quality item such as a Catstone.

Shiren will stop 1 tile before a buried item if you dash along the wall.<br/>
If nothing happens when you punch the wall after Shiren stops, take 1 step forward<br/>and destroy the adjacent wall tile to locate a buried item.<br/>(Wall Clip Bracelet can be used to obtain the item without destroying the wall)

### Maze Room

Room shaped like a maze.<br/>
It's treated as a room despite consisting of hallways, meaning items can be found.<br/>However, traps and stairs are never generated in mazes.<br/>
It's also possible for the entire floor to be a maze.

<div class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/maps/maze.png"/>
</div>

### Moving Floor

Room where the ground tiles shift around every few turns.<br/>
Only appears on floors with air tiles.

<div id="islandImage" class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/other/moving_floor.png"/>
</div>

### Launch Pad

Floor featuring launch pads instead of hallways to traverse between rooms.<br/>
The lack of hallways is rather dangerous since you risk getting surrounded,<br/>and you can also get hit by monsters at the end point if you jump to another room.

<div class="relativeImage screenshot">
  <img src="../images/other/launch_pads.png"/>
</div>

### Spear Door

Door that automatically closes when Shiren walks past.<br/>
Monsters have to break it before they can move past it, and it breaks rather easily.<br/>
Projectiles and magic bullets can fly through it and hit characters on the other side.<br/>The stairs are never located inside rooms with spear doors.

<div class="relativeImage smallScreenshot">
  <img src="../images/other/spear_gate.png"/>
</div>

Face the door and press A to manually open the door. (Doesn't end your turn)<br/>Unfortunately, this means you can't attack an enemy standing in front of a door<br/>unless you have the Tri-direct rune and aim diagonally.<br/>

### Iron Door

Door that automatically closes when Shiren walks past.<br/>
Monsters have to break it before they can move past it, and it's sturdier than spear doors.<br/>Projectiles and magic bullets cannot fly through it.<br/>
The stairs are never located inside rooms with iron doors.

<div class="relativeImage smallScreenshot">
  <img src="../images/other/iron_door.png"/>
</div>

Face the door and press A to manually open the door. (Doesn't end your turn)<br/>Like spear gates, you need the Tri-direction rune to hit an enemy standing in front of the door.

### Special Door

Door that automatically closes when Shiren enters the room and there's at least 1 monster.<br/>The doors only open after all monsters are defeated, or if you warp out of the room.<br/>Monsters won't try to break the doors, and will instead turn around.<br/>The stairs are never located inside rooms with special doors.

<div class="relativeImage smallScreenshot">
  <img src="../images/other/blue_doors.png"/>
</div>

### Lava

Tile where lava flows out and deals 30 damage to characters in a 1 tile radius after a few turns.<br/>Items are also destroyed, and the tile becomes impassable before lava flows out.<br/>Lava won't flow out if there's an object on the glowing tile.<br/>The stairs are never located inside rooms with lava.

<div class="relativeImage screenshot">
  <img src="../images/other/lava.png"/>
</div>

It's fire damage, so Zen Pot and the Anti-Fire rune are effective, and Flamebirds will be healed.<br/>Lava won't flow out inside a Monster House until all initially placed monsters are defeated,<br/>and if the entire floor was a monster house, lava won't flow out at all.<br/>

### Tidal Wave

Event exclusive to the DS version of the game.

The message "It's an earthquake! A tidal wave is impending." is displayed,<br/>
and then a tidal wave that affects the entire floor occurs after a few turns.<br/>
Unlike Flood Traps in Shiren 2, tidal waves don't deal any damage.

The terrain changes, items vanish, upgrade value of all equipment not in pots decreases by 1,<br/>scrolls get wet, peaches ripen by 1 stage, and onigiri turn into Rotten Onigiri.

There's a decent length of time before the tidal wave occurs, so you can usually<br/>make it to the stairs if you hurry unless you're very far away.
