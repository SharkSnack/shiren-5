## Overview

Status conditions are states that affect a character's behavior in various ways.<br/>
All statuses besides "Regular" can be categorized as positive or negative.

[Absorbiphant](/system/monsters#absorbiphant) monsters and the Sparrow [NPC](/system/npcs) can remove all status conditions<br/>
except for Super (and its boosts), Dueling, Dodger, Cautious, Reflective, and Zen.

For information about auras, check the [Gameplay Basics](/system/gameplay-basics) page.

#### Shiren

- Negative statuses can be removed by items like <span class="orangeText">Peach</span>, <span class="orangeText">Fixer Scroll</span>, or <span class="orangeText">Immunity Scroll</span>.<br/>(<span class="greenText">Immune</span> status will protect you from negative statuses)
- You can check your current status from the menu. (Other → Current State)
- Most status conditions wear off after a number of turns, or when you change floors.
- (However, <span class="greenText">Super</span> status and corresponding bonuses will remain active)
- Being revived by Revival Grass or Undo Grass will remove all status conditions<br/>except for Dodger, Cautious, Reflective, and Zen.

#### Allies

- Negative statuses can be removed by items like <span class="orangeText">Peach</span> or <span class="orangeText">Immunity Scroll</span>.<br/>(<span class="greenText">Immune</span> status will protect the ally from negative statuses)

#### Monsters

- Negative statuses can be removed by a <span class="orangeText">Peach</span> or <span class="orangeText">Cure Monster Trap</span>.<br/>(<span class="greenText">Immune</span> status will protect the monster from negative statuses)
- Nixer Scroll will have no effect if used on a monster that has a negative status.
