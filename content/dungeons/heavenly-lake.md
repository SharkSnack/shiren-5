Dungeon with a special rule where items placed on the ground outside of shops vanish.

Most items dropped by defeated monsters are lost, and item collection techniques can't be performed.<br/>
Mixer synthesis, hunting Froggo and Chow monsters for drops, throwing a pot to retrieve contents,<br/>
collecting arrows using arrow traps or Dodger Pot, etc. can't be done outside of shops.<br/>
※ Items eaten by Mixers or stolen by Zaloklefts won't vanish if they drop as a result of day and night switching.

Mixer family monsters appear on 10F, 20F, 40F, 50F, and 60F during the day,<br/>
and shops have a higher chance of being generated compared to other dungeons.

It's similar to 置けずの洞窟 from Shiren 4, but some item categories are identified and [New Items](/system/new-items) appear,<br/>
so as long as you've created strong New Items, it's easier than in Shiren 4... or so you might think.<br/>
There are some pretty mean floors in this dungeon:

- Trip Traps appear starting on 51F and cause item loss, and Floor Warp Traps can disrupt day/night plans.
- There are many water floors, so you often get swarmed by Floating and Aquatic types at the start of a floor.
- Vexing Kappa, Kappa Troll, Ultra Gazer (appears for 10 floors), Swordsman, Fencer, and Sensei appear.<br/>These monsters all have the potential to cause your main weapon, shield, or bracelets to be lost.
- Presto Pots don't have a limited item table like in Shiren 4, so you can't aim for Navigation or Night-Day scrolls.

As you can see, there are some additions that increase the difficulty compared to Shiren 4's similar dungeon.<br/>
If you play without New Items, the difficulty is on par with 置けずの洞窟, so give it a try if you're up for the challenge.<br/>
That said, if you don't care to play at the intended balance and just want to clear it or obtain [Expert Badges](/system/expert-badges),<br/>
it's best to create powerful New Item bracelets to drastically lower the difficulty.
