## 10.0.0

Styled Icons v10 introduces individual NPM modules for icon packs, originally introduced in v9, as the preferred way to install Styled Icons. It also deprecates single icon imports (`styled-icons/PACK/ICON`) on the main `styled-icons` package in favor of the new individual icon packages (`@styled-icons/PACK/ICON`).

To upgrade, you only need to update your code if you import icons individually (`styled-icons/PACK/ICON`) - you will need to change the following:

```typescript
import {Icon} from 'styled-icons/pack/icon'
```

To the following (also install the `@styled-icons/pack` module):

```typescript
import {Icon} from '@styled-icons/pack/icon'
```

All other imports from `styled-icons` still function as before (for instance `import {Icon} from 'styled-icons/pack'`), though you are welcome to migrate to the new `@styled-icons/PACK` modules. See the README for a list of icon packs.

- **(breaking)** Remove individual icon imports from the `styled-icons` package (`styled-icons/PACK/ICON`)
- Update documentation to introduce new `@styled-icons/PACK` NPM modules as the first-class install method

## 9.0.1

- Fix publish issue where built files were missing from `@styled-icons/styled-icon`

## 9.0.0

Styled Icons v9 adds individual icon pack NPM modules (`@styled-icons/pack-name`) for each icon pack - you now have the option of only installing specific packs. For instance:

```typescript
// this still works:
import {Alert} from 'styled-icons/material'

// NEW - this pack can be installed individually:
import {Alert} from '@styled-icons/material'
```

These new individual icon pack modules are _optional_, you can continue to utilize the `styled-icons` package as before.

- **(breaking)** removed `styled-icons/StyledIconBase` export - this is an internal export, this shouldn't affect your applications
- Create individual `@styled-icons/pack` NPM packages
- Upgrade Boxicons to v2.0.4
- Upgrade Feather Icons to v4.24.1
- Upgrade Octicons to v9.3.0

## 8.1.0

- Upgrade Font Awesome to v5.9.0

## 8.0.0

- **(breaking)** renamed the `Package` icon in all icon packs to `PackageIcon`. If you previously had the following:

  ```typescript
  import {Package} from 'styled-icons/pack-name'
  // or
  import {Package} from 'styled-icons/pack-name/Package'
  ```

  You will want to replace with:

  ```typescript
  import {PackageIcon} from 'styled-icons/pack-name'
  // or
  import {PackageIcon} from 'styled-icons/pack-name/PackageIcon'
  ```

  This fixes an issue experienced where certain bundlers would, on case-insensitive file systems, try to load a `package.json` file instead of the icon source.

## 7.0.0

#### Features

- Support automatic management of CommonJS and ES Modules code.

  Styled Icons will now correctly be imported as either CommonJS or ES Modules based on whichever the JavaScript bundler supports. This allows you to directly import an icon or an icon pack, and the bundler will automatically select the version it can process. This causes `styled-icons` to work out-of-the-box with Webpack, Rollup, Create React App, Next.js, Jest, Node, and many more!

  **(breaking)** if you previously imported icons with a `.cjs` suffix, you can remove the suffix as it is no longer required. For example, if you had any of this code:

  ```typescript
  import * as octicons from 'styled-icons/octicons.cjs'
  import {Alert} from 'styled-icons/octicons/Alert.cjs'
  ```

  You should remove the `.cjs` suffix:

  ```typescript
  import * as octicons from 'styled-icons/octicons'
  import {Alert} from 'styled-icons/octicons/Alert'
  ```

  The `.cjs` imports no longer exist in version 7.0.0.

#### Changes

- Removed the type imports from the root module entrypoint - these were deprecated in v6.0.0. If you need to import the type of a styled icon or its props, you should import those from `style-icons/types`:

  ```typescript
  import {StyledIcon, StyledIconProps} from 'styled-icons/types'
  ```

- Upgraded all dependencies, including upgrading the website to Next.js 8

#### Fixes

- Fixed an issue that prevented the `typicons` icons from being included in the bundle

## 6.5.0

- Upgrade Boxicons to v1.9.0

## 6.4.0

- Upgrade Octicons to v8.3.0
- Upgrade Cryptocurrency Icons to v0.10.0

## 6.3.0

- Fix issue where TypeScript compiler would evaluate all icon files, regardless of what icons were imported, significantly increasing compile time. This was due to the `StyledIcon` TypeScript type. To resolve, there is now a `styled-icons/types` import for that type. If you previously imported it from `styled-icons`, you should update to speed up your builds.

  If you previously had this code:

  ```typescript
  import {StyledIcon} from 'styled-icons'

  // or
  import {StyledIconProps} from 'styled-icons'
  ```

  You should replace it with:

  ```typescript
  import {StyledIcon} from 'styled-icons/types'

  import {StyledIconProps} from 'styled-icons/types'
  ```

## 6.2.1

- Fix issue where custom props that were not valid DOM attributes were passed through to the `<svg>` element

## 6.2.0

- Add Cryptocurrency icon pack

## 6.1.0

- Add Typicons icon pack

## 6.0.1

- No code changes, fix issue with broken CI deployment

## 6.0.0

- **(breaking)** remove an export of the `StyledIconProps` TypeScript type from each of the icon pack exports. This export was previously accidental. Each of the exports from the icon packs was assumed to be an icon, so unless you are depending on the extra export, you do not need to change anything.

  As an example, if you have this code:

  ```typescript
  import {StyledIconProps} from 'styled-icons/material' // or any other pack
  ```

  You should replace it with:

  ```typescript
  import {StyledIconProps} from 'styled-icons'
  ```

## 5.1.1

- No functional changes
- Updated repository to monorepo structure

## 5.1.0

- Add back an exported `StyledIcon` TypeScript type automatically generated from type of an icon

## 5.0.0

- **(breaking)** the TypeScript interface `StyledIcon` no longer exists and is not exported anymore.

  TypeScript types are now auto-generated from the `@types/styled-components` definitions rather than explicitly named as the `StyledIcon` interface. This allows `styled-icons` to pick up any changes introduced in `@types/styled-components` automatically, rather than needing to redefine the type to match any updates.

  If you need access to the `StyledIcon` type, you can define it yourself based on an icon import:

  ```typescript
  import {Alert} from 'styled-icons/octicons'
  export type StyledIcon = typeof Alert
  ```

  **Update:** there is now an exported `StyledIcon` type, defined using the above approach, exported from the root package available in v5.1.0:

  ```typescript
  import {StyledIcon} from 'styled-icons'
  ```
