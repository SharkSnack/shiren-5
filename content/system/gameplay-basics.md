## Shiren

### Experience Points

The amount of experience points needed to level up.<br/>
→ <a href="/other/experience-points">Experience Points Table</a>

### Necklace Abilities

Special attacks that can only be used at night.<br/>
→ <a href="/system/necklace-abilities">Abilities</a>

<div class="relativeImage smallScreenshot">
  <img src="../images/other/abilities_zoom.jpg"/>
</div>

### Fullness

Shiren has a fullness gauge (FG), and takes 1 damage per turn once it reaches 0.<br/>
Fullness decreases by 1 every 10 turns, so periodically eat food to replenish fullness.

<div class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/other/onigiri.png"/> <img src="../images/other/peach.png"/>
</div>

### Status Conditions

States that affect a character's behavior in various ways.<br/>
→ <a href="/system/status-conditions">Status Conditions</a>

<div class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/other/shiren_confused.png"/>
</div>

### Super Status

Shiren's status will change as you defeat enemies during an adventure.

- Regular → Awakened-ish → Super

<br/>

<div class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/other/shiren_super.gif"/>
</div>

#### Super Status

- Direct attacks can randomly inflict Asleep, Confused, Blind, Paralyzed,<br/>Sealed, Berserk, or Shadow Bound status.
- An additional bonus occurs every time you defeat 10 enemies:
    - Boost attack (3 floors)
    - Boost defense (3 floors)
    - Gain Swift status (50 turns / 100 turns from Shiren's perspective)
    - Gain Tinkerer status (2 floors)
    - Gain Fast Striking status (50 turns)
    - Gain Precise status (50 turns)
- Of these effects, attack and defense boosts stack up to 8 stages.

#### Deactivation

Super status can deactivate due to the following:

- Become afflicted by an ailment.
- Step on a trap.
- Hunger message is displayed. (20 and 10 remaining fullness)
- 0 fullness.
- HP display is red. (Current HP is &lt; 30% of max)

※ The "0 fullness" and "HP display is red" conditions perform a check every turn.

### HP Regeneration

Shiren's HP regenerates as he walks or steps in place (A+B).<br/>(HP won't regenerate when any other action is performed)

<div class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/other/turn_clock.png"/>
</div>

HP regeneration speed is linked to max HP, and slows down as your max HP increases.<br/>
Turns that restore 0 HP are introduced from 102 HP, and increase in frequency<br/>until you finally only restore 1 HP every 2 turns.

|Max HP | HP Restored  | Interval | Per Turn|
|-|-|-|-|
|15 ~ 50  | 1,2 |  2T  |1.50|
|51 ~ 66  | 1,1,1,2 |  4T | 1.25|
|96 ~ 101 | 1  | 1T | 1.00|
|102 |  1,1,1... 0|  50T |  0.98|
|104 |  1,1,1... 0 | 23T |  0.96|
|124  | 1,1,1,0  | 4T | 0.75|
|200 ~ |  1,0  | 2T | 0.50|

### Damage Calculation

[ Attack * Variance / 100 - Defense ] * Type Multiplier

The formula aside, the main things to note:

- The formula isn't the same as necklace ability damage calculation.
- Attack involves logarithm, so the latter has a smaller effect between increasing by 1<br/>at low level / strength vs. increasing by 1 at high level / strength.
- If strength is ≥ 8, strength is halved and decimals are dropped, so odd number values<br/>don't increase damage. (Example: 10 strength is the same as 11 strength)
- Equipment AP and DP are multiplied by about 0.6, so small increases in upgrade value<br/>aren't very noticeable.

### Accuracy

#### Direct Attacks

92% without a weapon.

Accuracy increases while equipped with a leveled up weapon.<br/>The <span class="greenText">Redeeming</span> rune raises accuracy to 100% for 1 hit after 2 misses.

|Weapon Level  |Lv1\~3   |Lv4\~5  | Lv6\~7  | Lv8|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Accuracy | 92%  | 93% |  94%  | 95%|

#### Projectiles

84%

#### Monster Direct Attacks

88% under normal circumstances.

Accuracy decreases if a Spry Shield is equipped. (Shiren's evasion increases)<br/>
The <span class="greenText">Agile</span> rune is equivalent to Spry Shield Lv1, so it's 78%.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Spry Shield</th>
    <th>Lv1</th>

## Item

### Point Card

<div class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/other/point_card.png"/>
</div>

Step on Point Switches while carrying a Point Card to accumulate points,<br/>which can then be exchanged at the Point Shop for various items.<br/>
→ Point Shop Items

Point Switch:

<div class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/traps/point_switch.png"/>
</div>

How to Obtain the Point Card:

1. Go to the basement of Hotel Nekomaneki and go through the Lot Shop event.
2. Go to the Point Shop (building next to Dungeon Center) and talk to the Pointman.

Notes:

- Points earned per Point Switch varies by dungeon and depth.
- If you lose the Point Card, you can have it reissued for 1000 Gitan.
    - The points you accumulated won't be lost.
- The Point Card's status affects points earned from Point Switches.
    - Sealed or inside a pot = 0 points.
    - Blessed = Double points, but blessing wears off after 1 use.
- Points reset to 0 if you end the game without suspending properly.

### Resonance

Certain weapons, shields, and bracelets activate special effects when equipped at the same time.<br/>
→ <a href="/system/resonance">Resonance</a>

<div id="resonanceImage" class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/other/resonance.png"/>
</div>

### Equipment Tags

Tags can be placed on weapons or shields, and ensures the item goes to Hermit's Hermitage if lost.<br/>Up to 8 tags can be placed on items, and the tag comes off when you pick the item up.<br/>The Sentry is located to the left of the Blacksmith.

<div class="relativeImage smallScreenshot">
  <img src="../images/other/tag.jpg"/>
</div>

Placing a tag:

- Purchase from Sentry (Hermit's Hermitage) or Shopkeepers for 3000 Gitan.
- Purchase from Tag Master for 2000 Gitan.
- Read a Tag Scroll and select a weapon or shield.

Tag removal:

- Request a tag removal. (Sentry or village shop)
- Tagged item was delivered to the Sentry.
- Sold the item inside a dungeon store.
    - Don't sell your tagged main weapon and shield when stealing!
- Chance to be removed when upgrade value decreases.
    - Safe if you keep your equipment plated.

Item is lost even with Tag:

- Item turned into Onigiri or Weeds.
- Item inserted into a Presto or Sale pot.
- Quit the game without suspending properly / game froze.
    - If you were carrying the item when this occurred.

### Equipment Growth

Weapons and shields earn growth experience points when you defeat enemies using direct attacks.<br/>For the sake of keeping the term short, this site refers to it as skill points.

※ You don't earn skill points if you defeat enemies using projectiles, abilities, magic bullets, etc.

<div class="relativeImage smallScreenshot">
  <img src="../images/other/equipment_level.png"/>
</div>

Notes:

- The item's name changes, and strength, upgrade limit, and rune count increase.<br/>(Example: Katana 6 atk / 8 limit → Good Katana 7 atk / 15 limit)
- Weapons or shields can gain runes through leveling up, and have a maximum level of 8.<br/>(Example: Beast Fang gains <span class="greenText">Rustproof</span> at Lv5)
- Skill points can't be seen, and each monster grants a predetermined amount.<br/>(Example: Mamel = 1 point)
- Generally, stronger / higher level monsters offer more skill points.<br/>(Example: Pit Mamel = 2 points, Cave Mamel = 100 points)
- Equipment levels up once the skill points total reaches the item's assigned threshold.<br/>(Example: Katana → Good Katana once skill point total reaches 300 points)

Check the [Monsters](/system/monsters) page for monster skill point values.

### Blessing / Curse / Seal

Items can be blessed, cursed, or sealed. (Excluding arrows, rocks, and talismans)<br/>
They can occasionally be found on the ground with these statuses, and you won't<br/>
be able to determine an unidentified items's status until you use it.<br/>

Once an item is identified, these statuses will be shown as an icon:

<table class="tableWithImages">
  <tr>
    <th>Icon</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Basic Effect</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="../images/other/blessed.png"/></td>
    <td>Blessing</td>
    <td>Boosted effect.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="../images/other/cursed.png"/></td>
    <td>Curse</td>
    <td>Can't unequip.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="../images/other/sealed.png"/></td>
    <td>Seal</td>
    <td>Unable to be used.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The effects of these statuses differ based on item category. (See table below)

- Gaining a status
    - Blessing: Blessing Scroll, Blessing Pot, night monster drop.
    - Curse: Curse Trap, Curse Girl special attack, Imabikiso, Curse Scroll, Curse Pot.
    - Seal: Curse Trap, item stolen by Bad Zalokleft (Lv1~3), Imabikiso, Curse Scroll, Curse Pot.
- Removing a status
    - Curse / Seal: Exorcism Scroll, Exorcism Pot, Fate Scroll, Earth Scroll, Plating Scroll,<br/>bless the item, Curse Breaker (Nekomaneki Village or wandering NPC).
    - Anti-Crs. Bracelet protects an item from getting cursed or sealed.

Effect details by item category:

|Item | Blessed |  Cursed  |Sealed|
|-|-|-|-|
|Weapon | Increased attack<br/>(Chance to wear off) | Can't unequip |  Upgrade value and runes are nullified,<br/>doesn't gain skill points|
|Shield | Increased defense<br/>(Chance to wear off) | Can't unequip |  Upgrade value and runes are nullified,<br/>doesn't gain skill points|
|Bracelet | Can't be cursed or sealed<br/>(Chance to wear off) | Can't unequip |  Bracelet's effect is nullified|
|Arrow, Rock |  -  | - |  -|
|Staff |  Doubled effect<br/>(Chance to wear off) | - |  Unable to be used, no effect if thrown|
|Talisman | - |  - |  -|
|Scroll | Reusable<br/>(Some exceptions <span class="orangeText">*1</span>) |  - |  Unable to be used|
|Grass |  Doubled effect<br/>(Some exceptions <span class="orangeText">*1</span>) |  -  | Unable to be used, no effect if thrown|
|Pot |  Can't be cursed, sealed,<br/>pecked, turned into onigiri<br/>(Chance to wear off) | -   |Can't use [Insert] or [Open] commands,<br/>can't be filled by Bored Kappa or Scoopie|
|Food | Doubled effect,<br/>peaches gain a bonus | - |  Unable to be used|
|Torch  | Doubled duration | -   |Can't be equipped|
|Point Card | Gain double points<br/>(Wears off after 1 use)|   -  | Unable to be used|

<p><span class="orangeText">*1</span> Exceptions:</p>

- Scroll
    - Extraction Scroll - Blesses all extracted items, but can't be reused.
- Grass
    - Upgrade Seed - Effect is active for the duration of the current floor. (Normally 100 turns)
    - Revival Grass, Undo Grass, Repeat Grass - Reusable.

### Synthesis

Synthesize weapons and shields to merge special abilities, upgrade value, and runes,<br/>and combine staves to add their use counts together.

<div id="resonanceImage" class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/other/runes.png"/>
</div>

#### Synthesis Effects

Weapons, Shields:

- First item is the base. Runes and upgrade value of subsequent items are added to it.<br/>(Example: Katana first, Scythe+1 second → Katana+1 with <span class="greenText">Anti-Plant</span> rune)
- Each item has a "rune count", and no more runes can be added once you reach the limit.<br/>(Example: Katana has 4 rune slots)
- Innate runes get stronger as the item levels up, but runes are always equal to Lv1 effect.<br/>(Example: Lv4 Scythe = 210%, Katana with <span class="greenText">Anti-Plant</span> rune = 135%)<br/>→ [Rune Multipliers](/system/synthesis-runes#multipliers)

Staves:

- Adds use counts together. Can only combine same name staves.<br/>(Example: Knockback Staff [3] first, Knockback Staff [4] second → Knockback Staff [7])

#### Different Category Synthesis

Normally, you can only synthesize weapons with weapons, and shields with shields.<br/>However, certain different category items can be synthesized by Mixers to add runes.<br/>
(Example: Weapon + Dragon Grass = <span class="greenText">Anti-Dragon</span> rune)<br/>→ Check [Rune List](/system/runes#rune-list) for all possible combinations.

#### Synthesis Methods

Synthesis Pot:

<div id="synthesisPot" class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/other/pot.png"/>
</div>

- Insert same category items to synthesize them. (Weapons, Shields, or Staves)
- Insert an identified staff last to result in an identified staff.

Mixer:

<div id="synthesisMixer" class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/other/mixer.png"/>
</div>

- Throw items at a Mixer to synthesize them. (Different category items can be synthesized)
- Mixers won't eat items when they're afflicted with certain [status conditions](/system/status-conditions).
    - Will eat: Any status conditions besides the ones listed below.
    - Won't eat: Napping, Asleep, Sound Asleep, Sealed, Paralyzed, S-Paralyzed, Onigiri, Tottering.
- Mixers can only eat a set number of items, based on their level.<br/>
(Mixer = 2, Mixermon = 3, Mixergon = 4, Mixerdon = 5)
- Throw an Expand Seed to increase the number of items a Mixer can eat by 1. (Max: 8)<br/>(Example: Throw an Expand Seed at a Mixer, then synthesize 3 items instead of 2)
- Mixers turn toward the direction the item came from when they eat an item.

#### Blessed, Cursed, Sealed, Identified

Synthesized items generally take on the status of the item that was inserted or thrown last.<br/>(Example: Remove a seal or curse from a weapon by synthesizing the weapon with an Iron Arrow)

※ Mixer synthesis has varied priority based on item category, so you may get unexpected results.

#### Mixer Synthesis Priority

Priority after throwing a weapon:

- Weapon > grass > scroll > staff > talisman or arrow > pot > bracelet.<br/>(This remains true even if items were thrown in a different order)

Example: If you throw a weapon → staff (sealed) → grass, the resulting weapon will be sealed,<br/>because grass has a higher priority than staves.

It's fine to throw non-equipment category items before the weapon or shield.

#### Common Mistakes

- Threw a Synthesis Pot while a Can. Arm Bracelet was equipped / Dracon Grass was active.
    - Check equipped bracelets and current status beforehand.
- Main weapon vanished after being thrown at a Napping Mixer.
    - Mixers function differently in Shiren 4 and 5, so always wake them up first.
- Stepped on an Explosion Trap / Pit Trap while walking over to the synthesized item.
    - Perform direct attacks over tiles to check for traps while approaching the item.
- Threw a weapon → Angel Seed → shield → Angel Seed, but only the weapon gained a rune.
    - Items that can be used to add runes to both weapons and shields always get synthesized<br/>onto the first weapon or shield, so use 2 different Mixers.
- A Pop Tank monster destroyed the item after synthesizing.
    - Use the Scout command to check for Pop Tank monsters on floors where they appear.
- The resulting staff became sealed after combining same name staves.
    - Swing the staff you to intend to synthesize last to check if it's sealed.

### New Items

Secret Pots located in the basement of Hotel Nekomaneki can be used to add new abilities to items.<br/>
→ [New Items](/system/new-items)

<div id="secretPotImage" class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/other/secret_pot.png"/>
</div>

### Catstones

Collect all 7 colors and clear Inori Cave to have a wish granted.<br/>→ Wishes List

<div id="catstone" class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/other/cat.png"/>
</div>

There are a number of different methods to obtain Catstones.<br/>The list below is in the order of how easy it is to obtain all 7 colors.

- Tanuki Passwords
    - Talk to Pokopon inside Hotel Nekomaneki and input Tanuki Passwords to obtain 1 set.<br/>※ Passwords can only be used once per save file.
- Rescue Passwords
    - Use Lost Well Pick-A-Choice Rescue Passwords.<br/>(See Collecting Catstones for details)
- Pick-A-Choice Shop
    - Same as above, but search for a Pick-A-Choice shop on your own.
- Purchase From Poo
    - Talk to Ah in Hotel Manekineko to hear Poo's current location,<br/>and then go there and purchase a Catstone for 3000G. (Random color)<br/>Poo's location is randomly selected from the list of dungeons you've entered before,<br/>and will change location after 7 or so adventures.
- Clear Destiny's Descent
    - The clear reward for this dungeon is a full set of Catstones.<br/>However, you need Catstones to even unlock this dungeon, and it's quite difficult,<br/>so it's not a very practical option.
- Elite Stores
    - You'll occasionally find Catstones for sale in elite stores.

### Friendship Licenses

Friendship Licenses are items that cause a monster family to act as allies and attack enemy monsters.

<div class="relativeImage smallScreenshot">
  <img src="../images/other/sproutant_license.png"/>
</div>

How to Obtain:

- Purchase at the License Shop in Nekomaneki Village.
- Read a Nixer Scroll while adjacent to an enemy monster.
- Defeat an enemy monster that is afflicted with Dueling status.

Notes:

- Ally monsters won't be attacked by enemies, and won't level up when they defeat other monsters.
- Shiren won't gain any experience points from ally monsters defeating enemies.
- If Shiren deals damage to an ally monster, all licenses for that family get destroyed.
    - Includes licenses inside pots.
- Licenses don't take effect if they're on the ground or inside pots.
- Licenses can turn into Blank Scrolls when leaving a floor where the family is in the monster table.
    - The check is also performed on licenses in pots, and seems to be around 10\~20%.
    - Example: In Gen's Turf, Mamel appears between 1-5F, and Pit Mamel between 3-7F.<br/>Therefore, 7 chances for Mamel Lic. to turn into a Blank Scroll.<br/>(1→2F, 2→3F, 3→4F, 4→5F, 5→6F, 6→7F, 7→8F)

Example:

If you have a Sproutant Lic. in your inventory (not inside a pot), all Sproutants, Sproutyrants,<br/>Sprouterrors, and Sproutitans on the current floor will attack enemies instead of you.

  <img src="../images/traps/wood_arrow.png"/> <img src="../images/traps/sleep.png"/> <img src="../images/traps/gauge_blind.png"/>
</div>

### Day / Night

Some dungeons have day and night cycles that change based on the number of elapsed turns.<br/>The Night Training Facility in Inori Village or NPC at the exit of Hermit's Hermitage offers a tutorial.

<div class="relativeImage screenshot">
  <img src="../images/other/night.jpg"/>
</div>

The monster table is different between day and night,<br/>and all monsters on the floor vanish and new ones are generated when time of day changes.

When it changes from:

- Day to Night → day monsters vanish, and night monsters are generated.
- Night to Day → night monsters vanish, and day monsters are generated.<br/>

Night:

- Direct attacks only deal 1 damage to night monsters, so use Necklace Abilities to defeat them.
    - Up to 8 abilities can be assigned. (Talk to the NPC in Hotel Nekomaneki to edit)
    - Once an ability is used, it can't be used again until you change floors or eat a peach.
    - Special effects from items like staves and scrolls are effective.
    - Fixed damage attacks like Dragon Grass also only deal 1 damage.
        - However, Empathy status and the Dispersing rune are effective.
- Field of view is reduced to a 1 tile radius.
    - Equip a torch to expand your field of view. (Higher grade torches provide a larger radius)
    - Night monsters deal far greater damage to you without a torch equipped.
    - Scrolls other than Fixer Scroll cannot be read at night without light.
- The Scout command cannot be used unless you've read a Navigation or Fixer scroll.
- Items dropped by night monsters are always blessed, and are chosen from the shop table.
    - In other words, generally higher quality than items you find on the ground.

Day:

- Direct attacks deal damage like normal to day monsters, and abilities cannot be used.

### Monsters

<div class="relativeImage">

</div>

### Monster Auras

<div id="auraImage" class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/other/blue_aura.png"/>
</div>

Status condition that monsters can have when they spawn naturally.<br/>
Monsters made to appear (Summon Trap, Mnster House Scrl, etc.) never have auras,<br/>
and some dungeons and specific floors have monster auras disabled.

Monster auras can be removed by reading a Dispel Aura Scroll, swinging a Seal Staff,<br/>or hitting the target with any talisman. However, monsters with auras provide double<br/>experience points, so it's important to take advantage of that when possible.

Aura effects vary by color:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Color</th>
    <th>Effect</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="highlightRed">Red</td>
    <td>Deal x2.5 damage. (3 stages of Buffed status)</td>
  </tr>
