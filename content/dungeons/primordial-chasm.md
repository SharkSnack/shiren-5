Shiren 5's version of the series favorite unidentified items post-game dungeon.<br/>
It's always daytime, the item table features a wide variety of items, and NPCs don't appear.<br/>
The first clear only requires you to reach 50F, and then the full 99F version is unlocked.

It's a standard dungeon, but the variety of strategies that can be used to clear it makes it extremely popular.<br/>
There are many weapon and shield options, and lots of ways to tailor the experience to your playstyle.<br/>
It tests identification, synthesis, Nigiri Morph Factory, collecting arrows, rushing stairs, and other techniques.<br/>
Grinding can be effective, but Wind of Kron and Ominous Auras both occur earlier than in other dungeons.

- A shop is guaranteed to be generated on 10F, 25F, 50F, and 75F.
- Imitation / odd effect items (Dracon Grass, Bankruptcy Scroll, etc.) can appear starting on 18F.

# Strategy

The basic strategy is to make your preparations between 1\~33F, and then dive through most floors.

</ul>

### Identifying Items

See [Identifying Items](/guides/identifying-items) for the basics.

The "YOLO" method where you just use the item is going to be the most used method in this dungeon.<br/>However, shops appear quite often, so being able to identify by price is also important.

Imitation items like Dracon Grass can appear starting on 18F,<br/>
so some players ignore unidentified items after 17F if they managed to identify the essentials.

#### YOLO Method

Identify Scroll or Identify Pot can identify items, and possibilities can be narrowed by checking prices.<br/>However, both of the above are unidentified at first, and if you have an inventory full of unidentified items,<br/>your run is likely to end if you encounter a tough situation where you need to use an item.<br/>Grasses and scrolls are consumed, but staves and talismans remain on hand.

When using unidentified items, there's no way to avoid using a negative effect item.<br/>The key is to put yourself in a position that limits how much a negative effect affects you beforehand.<br/>※ Items like Imabikiso and Amnesia Grass can only be found in shops (and Snacky, Maneater) here.

It's not realistic to account for every possible case, but the following are standard precautions:

<table class="dungeonTable">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Category</th>
      <th>Precaution</th>
      <th>What it watches out for</th>
    </tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Use after wiping out nearby enemies.</td>
      <td>Items that hinder combat like<br/>Sleepy Grass and Swift Foe Scroll.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Pot, Scroll (Select-type)</td>
      <td>Choose an unneeded item</td>
      <td>There's a chance you'll lose the item.<br/>Pot: 4-2-8, Black Hole, fragrance, etc.<br/>Scroll: Sale, Onigiri, Curse, etc.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="2">Staff, Talisman</td>
      <td>Use it on an enemy you can defeat if<br/>it happens to level up.</td>
      <td>Glorious Staff, Glorious Talisman</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Use it on a distant and weak enemy.</td>
      <td>Items that put you in a disadvantage<br/>like Pinning Staff and Swift Talisman.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Grass

Grass items are important synthesis ingredients, so avoid using them until Mixer (8-10F) floors.<br/>But if you find multiple copies of the same grass, it's fine to think about using one of them.<br/>Once you're past Mixer floors, it's generally fine to use grass after exploring the floor.<br/>The price range for synthesis ingredients are 100, 300, and 500.

Unidentified items are auto-identified if synthesis is successful, and Revival Grass is more common,<br/>so you tend to miss out and make the adventure harder for yourself if you use grasses early on.<br/>It's fine to eat grass that couldn't be synthesized, but don't use 500G grasses on floors<br/>where a shop is present, since Rage Grass could easily end your run.

Prices to remember:

- 50 --- Herb or Fine Grass (18F+)
- 100 --- Antidote Grass (<span class="greenText">Anti-Drain</span>), Warp Grass (<span class="greenText">Anti-Floating</span>), Otogiriso (<span class="greenText">Uplifting</span>), 1 other.
- 200 --- Heal Grass
- 300 --- Confusion Grass (<span class="greenText">Confusing</span>), Blinding Grass (<span class="greenText">Blinding</span>), Perception Grass (<span class="greenText">Anti-Cyclops</span>), 6 others.
- 500 --- Sleepy Grass (<span class="greenText">Sedating</span>), Dragon Grass (<span class="greenText">Anti-Dragon</span>), Life Grass (<span class="greenText">Energizing</span>), 3 others.
- 1000 --- Revival Grass or Gut Grass (18F+)
- 1500 --- Undo Grass or Repeat Grass (18F+)

Amnesia Grass and Imabikiso can appear in shops from 12F, and SuperUnlucky Seed from 30F.<br/>Snacky, Munchy, and Maneaters drop shop table items, so don't let your guard down.

#### Scrolls

There are few scrolls that can be identified via synthesis, so you tend to use scrolls to identify them.<br/>Read unidentified scrolls while standing on the stairs in case it's Muzzled or Grounded,<br/>or at the entrance of a room if you want to see if it's a Mnster House Scrl.

Save 800G scrolls you find before Mixer floors in case one of them is a Desert Scroll.<br/>
Use 500G (select-type scrolls) on an unneeded weapon or shield in case it's Fate, Earth, or Plating.

Prices to remember:

- 100 --- Navigation Scroll or Oil Scroll
- 200 --- Identify Scroll
- 300 --- Collection Scroll
- 500 --- (Select-type scrolls)
- 800 --- Desert Scroll (<span class="greenText">Anti-Aquatic</span>), 6 others.
- 1000 --- Confusion Scroll, Fixer Scroll, Immunity Scroll, Mnster House Scrl, 6 others.
- 3000 --- Lost Scroll (<span class="greenText">Bored</span>), 2 others.

#### Bracelets

It's fine to equip unidentified bracelets up until 8F since Karakuroids (6-8F) can create Strip Traps,<br/>but it's best to wait until you encounter a shop to identify by price from 9F onward.<br/>※ Never equip unidentified bracelets starting on 18F - it could be Itemphobic, Dozer Bracelet, etc.

The essential price point to remember for bracelets is 5000G.<br/>
The only 5000G bracelets on the ground before 18F are Alleyway, Blink, Explosion, and Nonary.<br/>Nonary is always cursed, and the other 3 are never sold in shops in Primordial Chasm,<br/>so bracelets being sold for 5000G in shops can only be Monster Detector, Item Detector, Heal, or Waterwalk.<br/>Monsterphobic and Itemphobic can appear in shops starting from 18F, but Itemphobic is always cursed.<br/>Wall Clip Bracelet can only be found in elite shops.

The 3000G bracelets are harder to identify, so they're a good candidate for Identify Pots.<br/>Alert and Mojo are the ones to watch for in particular.

#### Pots

Modder's Pot and Fever Pot can't be found on the ground.<br/>It's best to insert items other than arrows and talismans to identify pots.

### Equipment

See [Rune Details](/system/synthesis-runes#rune-details) to get an idea of synthesis priority.

Monster Detector, Wall Clip Bracelet, and Heal Bracelet are the 3 "sacred treasures" of the dungeon,<br/>but Wall Clip Bracelet is exclusively found in elite shops, so you're unlikely to obtain it.<br/>Therefore, equipment sets that activate 2 bracelet resonance aren't a high priority.<br/>Instead, the ideal pairing is any weapon that gains ∞ rune slots at Lv8 + Day Shield.

#### Weapon



##### Basic - Weapons without innate runes

- Dontakui, Bladite
    - Dotanuki and Bladite have 6 rune slots at Lv2, making early game synthesis easier.
    - Both are simple weapons with fast growth rates, making them great options.
- Red Blade
    - High base attack, but struggles with rune slots and growth rate.
    - Gains <span class="greenText">Uplifting</span> at Lv3, further making it lag behind the above two options.
    - Gains <span class="greenText">Flame Shot</span> at Lv8, which slows down the pace of the game.
- Kabura Katana
    - High base attack, but starts with only 2 rune slots, and incredibly slow growth rate.<br/>You can nearly level 2 Red Blades to Lv8 in the same amount of time it takes to level this to Lv8.
    - If you stick with it and hunt Maneaters, it gains at least 1 slot per level up and ends up powerful.
- Beast Fang
    - Faster growth rate than Dotanuki, and has enough base attack to at least be viable.

##### Status - Chance to inflict status increases based on level

- Baffle Axe
    - Fast growth, very high rune count.<br/>Great for those who like to overwhelm monsters with the power of runes.
- Blurry Stick
    - Slower growth than Baffle Axe, but not bad.
- Nap Rattle, Shockuto
    - Powerful ability, but neither one gains ∞ slots at Lv8.

##### Type Effective - Damage multiplier increases based on level

- Water Cutter, Scythe
    - Fast growth, and effective against a wide variety of monsters.
- Drain Dagger
    - Ensures you one-shot Absorbiphants, along with annoying Scorpions and Polygon Spinnas.
- Lizard Lasher
    - Hopodiles, Shaggas, and Dragons have high stats, so this is a great help against them.<br/>Slower growth than the others.
- Myopic Masher
    - Narrow range of effectiveness, but fast growth high rune count.
- Sky Splitter
    - Low base attack and slow growth, but can be viable if you level it by hunting Maneaters.

##### Dirk of Debts

- Dirk of Debts
    - Fast growth, gains 2 slots per level, your direct attacks deal x2.0 damage at Lv8.
    - It varies a bit based on strength and buffs, but it's possible to one-shot even end game monsters.
    - Tricky to wield early\~mid game, but once you reach the 75F shop, you can main it without worry.<br/>Gitan Mamels and Kleptoads (80-82F), Ultra Gazers (88-93F) also help out with costs.
    - Only recommended if you're confident in your ability to steal from shops.

#### Shield

##### Damage Reduction

- Day Shield
    - Since this is a day-only dungeon, it's an unconditional 60% damage reduction at Lv8.<br/>No questions - Nothing rivals it, so just use it as a main shield if you find it.
- Binary Shield
    - 85% damage reduction if last digit of current HP is 1 or 0 at Lv8.<br/>It gets tiresome to keep track of HP, but it's extremely effective if you're diligent.
- Pauper's Plank
    - Damage reduction increases to 50% at Lv8, but with a pretty heavy drawback of 250G per hit.

##### Other Shields

Less effective than % damage reduction, and not much help against end game monsters.<br/>
However, some are nice to level as synthesis ingredients thanks to their added runes.

- Plain Targe
    - Gains <span class="greenText">CR Diet</span> at Lv8.
- Binary Shield
    - Gains <span class="greenText">Magi-Twister</span> at Lv6.
- Red Shield
    - Gains <span class="greenText">Anti-Fire</span> and <span class="greenText">Anti-Peck</span> at Lv8.
