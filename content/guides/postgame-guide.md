# Overview

Congratulations on clearing the main story! You're now finished with the tutorial.<br/>That's right - the main story was just the tip of the iceberg that is Shiren 5.

There are 30 other dungeons besides Tower of Fortune with a wide variety of rules.<br/>Not only that, there are mini-games and sidequests to tackle, and an encyclopedia to complete.<br/>And if you're playing on Vita or Steam, there are 55 [trophies](/system/trophies) to aim for.

This page provides a list of objectives to work toward, along with recommendations on where to start.<br/>Most importantly, what you do next depends on what sounds fun based on your playstyle.

See [Rescue Passwords](/guides/rescue-passwords) for details.

### Collect Points

<div class="relativeImage smallScreenshot">
  <img src="../images/other/point_card.png"/>
</div>

Lots of points are needed in order to quickly level up and upgrade equipment.

#### Destiny Trail

This can be done once you have a Point Card and 2 Trap Bracelets.

1\~2F of Destiny Trail only has Point Switches for traps, so the idea is to generate<br/>lots of Point Switches by passing turns while having both Trap Bracelets equipped.<br/>You usually get somewhere around 3,000 ~ 4,000 points per trip.

Needed Items:

- Trap Bracelet x 2
- Escape Scroll or Undo Grass

Steps:

1. Equip a weapon and shield that grants 2 bracelet [resonance](/system/resonance), and equip the Trap Bracelets.
2. Ensure you have an Escape Scroll or Undo Grass in your inventory.
3. Go to Destiny Trail, step in place to spawn Point Switches, and step on them to collect points.
4. Repeat until Wind of Kron blows.
5. Read the Escape Scroll or use the Undo Grass to return to Nekomaneki Village.

#### Gorger's Manor

This can be done once you've significantly upgraded your equipment.

Gorger's Manor offers 200 points per Point Switch near the end. (47\~50F)<br/>Bring Trap Scrolls, Trap Deletion Scrl, Extraction Scrolls, and Blessing Pot to generate Point Switches.<br/>You usually get somewhere around 30,000 ~ 50,000 points per trip.

Needed Items:

- Preservation Pot[5] --- blessed Trap Scroll x 4, blessed Trap Deletion Scrl x 1
- Preservation Pot[5] --- Extraction Scroll x 5 (Bring lots of these pots)
- Blessing Pot x 1
- Undo Grass

Steps:

1. Go to 47F of Gorger's Manor.
2. Read 4 Trap Scrolls (once per scroll), then read Trap Deletion Scrl.
3. Insert the 4 Trap Scrolls and 1 Trap Deletion Scrl into the Blessing Pot.
4. Read an Extraction Scroll to retrieve the 4 Trap Scrolls and 1 Trap Deletion Scroll.
5. Repeat 1~2 times if you want, and then step on all Point Switches.
6. Do this over and over until Wind of Kron blows.
7. Use the Undo Grass or clear the dungeon to return to Nekomaneki Village.

### Level Up Equipment

<div class="relativeImage smallScreenshot">
  <img src="../images/other/equipment_level.png"/>
</div>

Once you have lots of points, you can start exchanging them to help with leveling up equipment.<br/>Blank Scrolls cost 200 points each, and can be turned into Gambler's Scrolls, Extraction Scrolls, etc.<br/>The idea is to read lots of Gambler's Scrolls in Destiny Trail for the weapon and shield level up effect.

Needed Items:

- Preservation Pot[5] --- blessed Gambler's Scroll x 5
- Preservation Pot[5] --- Extraction Scroll x 5 (Bring lots of these pots)
- Blessing Pot x 1
- Shield with Anti-Blast rune --- Keep this equipped.
- Weapons and shields --- Whichever ones you want to level up.
- Undo Grass

Steps:

1. Place whatever weapons and shields you want to level up in your inventory. (Outside of pots)
2. Go to Destiny Trail 5F.
3. Read 5 Gambler's Scrolls (once per scroll).
4. Insert the 5 Gambler's Scrolls into the Blessing Pot.
5. Read an Extraction Scroll to retrieve the 5 Gambler's Scrolls.
6. Repeat until all of your weapons and shields reach Lv8, or you run out of Extraction Scrolls.
7. Use the Undo Grass to return to Nekomaneki Village.

### Upgrade Equipment

<div class="relativeImage monsterImage">
  <img src="../images/other/equipment_growth.jpg"/>
</div>

Once your equipment is Lv8, it's time to read Fate and Earth scrolls to increase upgrade value.<br/>This can be done inside the Nekomaneki Village warehouse, provided there's enough space on the ground.

Needed Items:

- Preservation Pot[5] --- blessed Fate or Earth Scroll x 5
- Preservation Pot[5] --- Extraction Scroll x 5 (Bring lots of these pots)
- Blessing Pot x 1
- Weapons and shields --- Whichever ones you want to upgrade.

Steps:

1. Go inside the Nekomaneki Village warehouse, and ensure there's 5 tiles of space on the ground.
2. Read 5 Fate or Earth scrolls (once per scroll).
3. Insert the Fate or Earth scrolls into the Blessing Pot.
4. Read an Extraction Scroll to retrieve the 5 Fate or Earth scrolls.
5. Repeat until upgrade value reaches +99, or you run out of Extraction Scrolls.

### Synthesize Powerful Runes

<div class="relativeImage smallScreenshot">
  <img src="../images/other/runes.png"/>
</div>

It's time to finalize your main weapon and shield by synthesizing the best runes.<br/>Some of the ingredients can be tricky to find on your own, so check [Rescue Passwords](/guides/rescue-passwords).

※ If you're using Shugoseki Swd as a main weapon, it's recommended to erase Flame Shot.

Mixergons can be found between 1-2F of Lost Well, and can eat up to 4 items.<br/>If your equipment isn't strong enough yet, you can go to Tower of the Future or Inori Cave instead.

See [Runes](/system/synthesis-runes) for details.
